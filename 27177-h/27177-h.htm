<h2><!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following Discourses are presented to the public in book
form, agreeable to the request of numerous friends.&nbsp; I have
selected twenty from one hundred and thirty which I have given to
my own congregation during the past three years.&nbsp; I have
tried to have them lean one against another, to the end that the
argument might be continuous and somewhat complete.&nbsp; The
reader will remember, however, that the vast subject of which
they treat, cannot be fairly and completely presented in such a
volume as this.&nbsp; Also, it should be borne in mind that the
language, style, and structure, are sermonic.&nbsp; Pulpit
literature, in these things, is peculiar and distinctively
characteristic.</p>
<p>When I first entered the ministry, I made up my mind that I
would try and thoroughly understand the Scriptures.&nbsp; I soon
found that a large portion was of a prophetic nature.&nbsp; I set
to work according to the usual method, but to my sorrow I soon
discovered that the method and rules in general use for Scripture
exegesis, among what they called orthodox authors, were very
defective and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The fact was forced upon me
that the true method, or key of interpretation, was not in
use.&nbsp; I was always persuaded that the Bible was a unit, and
that the principles contained in such a unit were beautifully
related; and because of such a faith, I wondered more and more as
I grew older why we had not a better key of interpretation.&nbsp;
Men <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>spiritualised at random, without any
kind of rule, except their own fancy.&nbsp; In this manner they
expounded the material history of the Old Testament.&nbsp; The
whole arrangement was a Babel.</p>
<p>I had faintly discerned that the Scriptures made a distinction
between the House of Israel and the House of Judah, and that the
prophecies belonging to one could not, in fairness, be applied to
the other; and that some prophecies applied to both.&nbsp; It
always seemed strange to me, that the people which God said He
had chosen for Himself, should not be known.&nbsp; The Jews were
always known, but where was &ldquo;Israel, His
inheritance?&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, I could see no point in the Lord
swearing so positively about David&rsquo;s seed and throne
lasting to the end of time.&nbsp; Taking them in a typical sense,
they were about the poorest types that could have been selected,
because of the shortness of their existence, according to the
general mode of interpretation.&nbsp; Just at this point of my
experience I came across a book, entitled &ldquo;Our Israelitish
Origin,&rdquo; by the late John Wilson, the reading of which
confirmed me in my convictions, and aided me to a better
knowledge of the good Book of Providence.</p>
<p>After some twenty years of experience, I began to teach the
principles of interpretation embodied in these discourses.&nbsp;
Some three years ago I began to give a series of sermons on the
Ten Lost Tribes.&nbsp; I soon found my own congregation, as well
as the public, were interested and profited with the same, as was
manifest from the large and constant attendance thereon.&nbsp; By
personal interviews and letters, I have been gratified to learn
that many have been savingly and truly converted to God through
these Discourses.&nbsp; Especially has this been the case with
those who were infidel in faith and action towards God and His
Word.&nbsp; I have received hundreds of letters thanking me that
the key of interpretation presented had made the Bible <!-- page
xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>an interesting and easily understood book.&nbsp; The
interest created gave rise to numerous requests for copies of my
sermons.&nbsp; The notice by the public press now and again
intensified the interest and increased the demand.&nbsp; To meet
this desire I made arrangements with the editor and proprietor of
a weekly paper called the <i>Champion</i> to publish my evening
Discourses.&nbsp; At once the arrangement was found to be
profitable to him, agreeable to me and admirably suited to the
public.&nbsp; So for more than a year the <i>Champion</i> has
been my faithful messenger on this line, and will continue to
be.&nbsp; It is a weekly paper, published at 132, Nassau Street,
New York; price one dollar per year.&nbsp; I am not personally
interested more than this.&nbsp; With its politics and other
matter I have nothing to do; but for the sermonic matter I hold
myself responsible.&nbsp; I feel free to express my pleasure in
the wonderful increase of its circulation.&nbsp; I am glad it
goes all over the States, the Dominion of Canada, and is in
goodly demand in Great Britain.</p>
<p>After I had been preaching on this subject for some time, I
made, fortunately, the acquaintance of a name-sake of mine, Mr.
Joseph Wild, of Bay Ridge, near Brooklyn.&nbsp; On this subject I
found him remarkably well posted.&nbsp; He had lots of books,
pamphlets, papers, and maps on the matter, any or all of which he
gave me liberty to use.&nbsp; Through him my attention was called
to the valuable writings of our English brethren on this point,
Edward Hine, Rev. Mr. Glover, M.A., Rev. Mr. Grimaldi, M.A.,
Philo-Israel, and a host of others, whose writings have helped me
very much.&nbsp; Our English friends have now a vast store of
this kind of literature; while, so far as I know, we have no home
production.&nbsp; This is one reason I feel satisfied in sending
forth this volume.</p>
<p>For years I have been greatly interested in Pyramidology, in
<!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>the teachings of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh in
Egypt.&nbsp; Twenty years ago I had confidence to lecture
frequently on the subject, and a few years since it was in my
mind to publish a small work on it.&nbsp; The necessity of such
work was wisely and competently taken out of my hands, however,
by the appearance of a book entitled, &ldquo;The Stone
Miracle,&rdquo; by Rev. Dr. Seiss, of Philadelphia.&nbsp; This is
a book admirably suited to beginners on this line of study.&nbsp;
And if one wants to go further and be specially informed on
Pyramidology, why let them get &ldquo;Our Inheritance in the
Great Pyramid,&rdquo; a work by Professor Piazzi Smyth,
Astronomer-Royal of Scotland.&nbsp; To this man God has given a
fine mind and a large heart for a special place and work.&nbsp;
But what pleases me above all, is that this Pyramid, being the
<i>Lord&rsquo;s Pillar</i>, and <i>His Witness</i>, should so
finely tally with the Scriptures and Providence; that the
teachings of this monument are in harmony with the principles of
interpretation, as applied to the prophecies in these
Discourses.</p>
<p>By several small engravings I have sought to aid the mind of
the reader through the eye.&nbsp; In the Royal Arms of England
there is considerable of history; the position of the lions,
unicorn, crown, and indeed all connected with it is significantly
expressive.&nbsp; In these things, the accidental grouping, so
far as man was concerned, were as much under Divine supervision
as the blundering of the Jews in the crucifying of Jesus.&nbsp;
So, Divinely considered, they Divinely reveal.&nbsp; We know not
the mind of our fathers in the matter of selecting and composing
the items that make up the great seal, but we know the mind of
Providence.</p>
<p>The plate of the ragged old stone, called Jacob&rsquo;s
pillow, is not very distinct, but it is the best we could
do.&nbsp; As it is, it will aid the reader in forming a better
idea.&nbsp; The stone in shape <!-- page xv--><a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>is an oblong
square, about 32 inches long, 13 broad, and 11 inches deep.&nbsp;
At each end is an iron ring, much worn and rusted.&nbsp; It is a
bluish steel-like colour, mixed with some veins of red.&nbsp; It
has been in its present resting place 583 years.</p>
<p>The main idea I wish to convey in this book, is that God is
conducting His Providence through His ancient chosen people,
Israel, whom I believe are found in the Saxon race.&nbsp; And His
throne on earth, through which flow the purposes of Providence,
is David&rsquo;s throne, which I believe to be at present the
English throne.&nbsp; Queen Victoria (and God bless her) I
believe to be of David&rsquo;s seed.&nbsp; The United States
fulfils the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the Tribe of Manasseh.&nbsp;
Therefore, to understand the prophecies, Providence, and the
present movement of nations, as well as the future lot and
destiny of each, we must read the Scriptures in this light.&nbsp;
God has made the children of Israel and throne of David His
executive, in time, on earth.&nbsp; They are His executive for
civilisation, evangelisation, order, and conquest.&nbsp; Through
them God will conquer the world to an universal peace.&nbsp; As
Moses was to God, so is Israel.&nbsp; Moses being a Divine
executor, was to the people a god&mdash;so is Israel to all
mankind.&nbsp; Spiritual Israel will come through literal
Israel.</p>
<p>I have expressed myself freely, and shall cheerfully grant
reviewers, critics, and readers, the same privilege.&nbsp; I send
forth this book with a pure desire that it may do good.&nbsp;
Amen, so mote it be.</p>

17</span>KEY DISTINCTIONS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Discourse</span> I.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have a more sure word of prophecy;
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star
arise in your hearts.&nbsp; Knowing this first, that no prophecy
of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.&rdquo;&mdash;2
Peter i. 19, 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am about to give you a few Discourses on Prophecy, and in
doing so I desire, in the first place, to point out to you a few
very important distinctions included in the prophecies.&nbsp;
Suppose the Bible to be a great palace, with its royalty, royal
children, servants, and subjects.&nbsp; You desire to go through
it and view it intelligently, and to understand all about its
inhabitants and laws of government; now to do so, you must have
keys, and you must learn who is who, their place, authority, and
work.&nbsp; If not so qualified, you could not pass from room to
room, and you might confound the King with some servant, and
visitors might be mistaken for the children of the
household.&nbsp; Thus your ideas would be considerably mixed; you
would be guilty of talking about the King, when you really meant
some servant, and of prophesying for the royal children in the
name of the visitors.&nbsp; The years would come and go, but
events would not happen as you had prophesied.&nbsp; Each <!--
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>generation would take your report and follow in your
footsteps, thus confusion and disappointment would keep pace with
the passing generations.</p>
<p>What is here made a matter of supposition, has been a solemn
fact on the line of human experience.&nbsp; Men have studied the
Bible and Providence in this ignorant and confused way.&nbsp;
Theologians have thrown aside all restraints, and well-defined
limitations and distinctions of the Bible in their assumed
liberty of expounding and spiritualising the same.&nbsp; No
matter to them that there is a God-revealed distinction between
Judah and Israel, Manasseh and Ephraim, Samaritans and Gentiles,
and the throne of David and the throne of the heathen.&nbsp;
Writers and speakers are guilty of using the words Judah and
Israel in a synonymous sense, though the words stand for
different people, history, and prophecies, soon after the
descendants of Jacob settled in Palestine.&nbsp; To aid you in
seeing this historical confusion and folly, let me call your
attention to them separately.</p>
<h3>JUDAH.</h3>
<p>What does this word stand for in the Bible?&nbsp; In the
<i>first</i> place it is the name of the fourth son of
Jacob.&nbsp; In the <i>second</i> place it was the name of his
direct descendants or Tribe.&nbsp; In the <i>third</i> place it
became the name of the portion of the country occupied by this
Tribe in the Promised Land.&nbsp; In the <i>fourth</i> place it
became the name of a kingdom and government; this fourth name
included the Tribe of Benjamin and their territory.&nbsp; In the
<i>fifth</i> place it became the name of the whole country of
Palestine, and is now often so used.&nbsp; To-day this word
stands for those we call Jews, who, as they allow among
themselves, represent and only include Judah and Levi.</p>
<p>On the death of Solomon the country and Tribes finally
separated into two Houses, kingdoms, and governments.&nbsp; Nine
Tribes went with Jeroboam, and three with Rehoboam&mdash;namely,
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Judah, Levi, and Benjamin.&nbsp; The nine-tribed House
was called Israel, the three-tribed House Judah.&nbsp; This
separation was about 975 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (1 Kings
xii.).&nbsp; From that day to this these two Houses have never
been united; but they are to be, as scores of statements to that
effect are in the good Book (Hosea i. 11).&nbsp; About 580 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> the House of Judah was taken captive
into Babylon, remaining 70 years, then they returned to their own
land and remained till the year of our Lord 70, when Jerusalem
was destroyed and they were scattered.</p>
<p>Prophecies referring to the Jews are numerous and in striking
contrast to those that refer to Israel.&nbsp; 1. The Jews were to
be a scattered people.&nbsp; 2. A specially persecuted
people.&nbsp; 3. To be without a nationality.&nbsp; 4. To be
without government.&nbsp; 5. Not to be owners of landed property,
though they will have money, until toward the latter days.&nbsp;
6. They were to be a proverb.&nbsp; 7. They were to be few in
number.&nbsp; 8. They are to retain a special type of
features.&nbsp; 9. They were to be repeatedly robbed.&nbsp; 10.
They were to reject Christ.&nbsp; 11. To retain the Mosaic
service till returned to their own land.&nbsp; 12. They are to
keep their name, and many such distinctions, none of which should
be applied to Israel.&nbsp; All these things have been and are
fulfilled, or fulfilling, and though men are wonderfully given to
spiritualising, few, if any, venture to spiritualise
Judah&rsquo;s curses.&nbsp; Men and ministers calling themselves
Gentiles, are rude enough to spiritualise the blessings of Judah,
and stealing them, apply them to themselves.</p>
<h3>ISRAEL.</h3>
<p>1. A name given to Jacob after wrestling with the Angel.&nbsp;
2. A term applied sometimes to all the descendants of
Jacob.&nbsp; 3. In a spiritual sense, those who believe in
Christ.&nbsp; 4. A name that covered and included the nine Tribes
which went with Jeroboam and formed the kingdom of Israel.&nbsp;
They remained a distinct kingdom, and till now a
nationality.&nbsp; From 975 to <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>725 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> they had some 19 kings.&nbsp; They were
finally carried captive into Assyria by Shalmanezer (2 Kings
xvii.).&nbsp; From that captivity they have never returned; as a
body they never can, only representatives, as stated in Jer. iii.
14, &ldquo;One of a city, and two of a family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now prophecy points out that it was Israel that was to be lost
for a while, and come to light in the latter day.&nbsp; They are
known in the Scriptures in contradistinction from others by such
terms as the following: &ldquo;<i>All Israel</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>All the House of Israel wholly</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>The House of Israel</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Men of
Israel</i>,&rdquo; and God calls them His &ldquo;<i>Servants</i>,
<i>Witnesses</i>, <i>Chosen People</i>, <i>Inheritance</i>, and
<i>Seed</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lot, course, and providential
portion of this people are very marked from any other, especially
from the Jew, with whom they are so often confounded.&nbsp; The
history of the two peoples have been wide apart and as different
as they well could be.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; They were to be <i>lost</i>.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; They were
to be <i>divorced</i> from the Mosaic law.&nbsp; 3. They were to
lose their <i>name</i>.&nbsp; 4. They were to lose their
<i>language</i>.&nbsp; 5. They were to <i>possess</i> the isles
of the sea, coasts of the earth, waste and desolate places, to
inherit the portion of the Gentiles, their seed, land, and
cities. 6.&nbsp; They are to be great and successful
<i>colonisers</i>.&nbsp; 7. Before them other people are to
<i>die out</i>.&nbsp; 8. They are to be a <i>head</i>
nation.&nbsp; 9. To be a <i>company</i> of nations.&nbsp; 10. To
be <i>great</i> in war on land or sea.&nbsp; 11. To be
<i>lenders</i> of money.&nbsp; 12. To have a
<i>monarchy</i>.&nbsp; 13. To be <i>keepers</i> of the
Sabbath.&nbsp; 14. To have David&rsquo;s <i>throne</i> and seed
ruling over them.&nbsp; 15. They are to <i>possess</i> Palestine,
and invite their brethren of Judah to return.&nbsp; And thus I
might repeat some sixty positive marks and distinctions setting
forth Israel; and yet men wilfully persist in confounding them
with the Jews, or looking for this great and favoured people of
the Lord among the lowest of human kind, Indians, Africans, and
so on.</p>
<h3><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>SAMARITANS.</h3>
<p>The Samaritans were not Jews or Israelites, strictly
speaking.&nbsp; They of course became Jewish in their customs and
worship.&nbsp; Originally they were Assyrians.&nbsp; When the
nine Tribes were carried captive, they were brought and put in
their place.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the King of Assyria brought men
from Babylon and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and
from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria,
instead of the children of Israel&rdquo; (2 Kings xvii.
24).&nbsp; The Jews and the Samaritans never wholly mixed; one
was always distasteful to the other.&nbsp; They never were taken
captive, and to this day they live in and about Mount Scychar,
numbering between three and four hundreds.</p>
<h3>BENJAMIN.</h3>
<p>The Tribe of Benjamin has a singular and special place in the
history of Israel and Judah.&nbsp; Neither the Old or New
Testament can be well understood unless one understands the place
of this Tribe in Providence.&nbsp; They were always counted one
of the Ten Tribes, and reckoned with them in the prophetic
visions.&nbsp; They were only loaned to Judah about 800
years.&nbsp; Read 1 Kings xi.&nbsp; They were to be a light for
David in Jerusalem.&nbsp; God, foreseeing that the Jews would
reject Christ, kept back this one Tribe to be in readiness to
receive Him, and so they did.&nbsp; At the destruction of
Jerusalem they escaped, and after centuries of wanderings turn up
as the proud and haughty Normans.&nbsp; Finally they unite with
the other Tribes under William the Conqueror.&nbsp; A proper
insight into the work and mission of Benjamin will greatly aid
one in interpreting the New Testament.&nbsp; He was set apart as
a missionary Tribe, and at once set to work to spread the Gospel
of Jesus.&nbsp; Most of the disciples were Benjaminites.&nbsp;
Then, after 800 years of fellowship with Judah, they were cut
loose and sent after their brethren of the House of Israel.&nbsp;
It was needful that the Lion and the Unicorn should unite.</p>
<h3><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>MANASSEH AND EPHRAIM.</h3>
<p>The history of these two representative characters is worth
your careful study.&nbsp; The whole of the circumstances of Jacob
blessing them must be accepted as Divinely directed.&nbsp;
Manasseh was to be a great people, and so I believe he is.&nbsp;
In the United States I find this promise literally
fulfilled.&nbsp; This is the Key to the settlement of this land;
to the agitations of the Pilgrims and Puritans in England.&nbsp;
The mission, work, and place of the United States may be found in
the prophecies relating to this Tribe.&nbsp; Let anyone examine
the great seal of the United States, and study its design, and
surprise will fill the mind that facts, Providence, and
prophecies do so wonderfully agree.&nbsp; Take the obverse
side.&nbsp; Here you have an eagle with outstretched wings; the
bird is perfect, not double headed and deformed, as in other
cases where the eagle has been or is the national bird.&nbsp; The
striped escutcheon on its breast, in its beak a scroll, inscribed
with a motto, &ldquo;<i>E pluribus Unum</i>&rdquo;&mdash;one out
of many, as Manasseh was, and as the country is building up a
grand nationality and oneness out of all nations nearly.&nbsp;
Over the head of the eagle there is a <i>glory</i>&mdash;the
parting of clouds by light; in the opening appear 13 stars,
forming a constellation argent, on an azure field.&nbsp; In the
dexter or right talon is an olive branch, a symbol of peace; in
the sinister or left talon is a bundle of 13 arrows.&nbsp; But it
is on the reverse side of the great seal that we have a
wonder.&nbsp; Here we have an unfinished Pyramid; a portion of
the top is gone, exactly the same as the Great Pyramid in Egypt
is at this day&mdash;anticipating this very day (Isa. xix. 19):
&ldquo;In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord.&nbsp; And
it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts
in the land of Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it is somewhat singular
that the Congress of 1782 should have adopted so remarkable a
sign, one that would witness to God and tell of their
origin.&nbsp; The reverse side is the under side, and shows from
whence the nation came, and on what it is <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>built.&nbsp;
In the zenith&mdash;that is, above the top of the
Pyramid&mdash;is a triangle surrounded by a glory; and in the
centre is an all-seeing eye.&nbsp; Over the eye we have <i>Annuit
C&oelig;ptis</i>, which means, &ldquo;<i>He prospers our
beginning</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the base of the Pyramid we have in
letters, 1776, and underneath the following
motto&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Novus ordo seclorum</i>,&rdquo; meaning a
&ldquo;New era in the ages.&rdquo;&nbsp; The suggestion of the
items upon the great seal was from Sir John Prestwich, Bart., an
Englishman.&nbsp; He gave the suggestions to the American
Minister, John Adams, and thus the same were conveyed to Congress
and adopted.</p>
<p>We have in the facts of the great seal a series of coincidents
that connect this country with the Tribe of Manasseh.&nbsp; When
the Tribes marched, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh went together
on the West side of the ark, for their homes were Westward.&nbsp;
On their battalion banner was the figure of a youth, denoting
activity, with the motto, &ldquo;The cloud of Jehovah rest on
them, even when they go forth out of the camp.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
we have the origin of the cloud on the seal.&nbsp; And when we
remember that Manasseh was brought up at the foot of the Pyramid,
and could see it from his palace home at Memphis, then we get a
cue to the figure of the Pyramid on the seal. <a

class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<h3>PYRAMID.</h3>
<p>The Pyramid is a wonderful witness for God and His
people.&nbsp; This building in Egypt has stood for 4,000 years;
finished and complete, it stood for about 3,000 before anybody
ventured to find a way into it.&nbsp; Then, at a great cost of
men, money, and time, a way was forced in by an Arab chief.&nbsp;
There surely is something remarkable that the only thing found in
it should be a stone trough, and more singular to my mind, that
the Ark of the Covenant and this stone trough should be of equal
capacity; and the laver in which the priest washed his feet in
the <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>temple was exactly of the same size.&nbsp; And
Solomon&rsquo;s molten sea contained just as much water as would
fill the King&rsquo;s Chamber in which this trough was
found.&nbsp; Can any man know these things and believe them to be
accidental?&nbsp; Verily not.&nbsp; They do most assuredly pledge
a God and Providence.</p>
<h3>EPHRAIM.</h3>
<p>This word is not only the name of Joseph&rsquo;s son and the
Tribe, but it is used quite frequently in a generic sense, and
stands for the Ten Tribes and Manasseh.&nbsp; To Reuben by
birthright was the lead politically, but it was taken from him
and given to Joseph, and so to Ephraim.&nbsp; From Judah came the
Chief Ruler&mdash;that is, Christ; but the birthright was
Joseph&rsquo;s (1 Chron. v. 1).</p>
<h3>THRONE OF DAVID.</h3>
<p>To this throne God pledged under oath a perpetuity.&nbsp; Also
He pledged that some one of David&rsquo;s seed should always be
on it.&nbsp; The throne and seed are pledged an unconditional
existence.&nbsp; This being so, it follows that they must be now
in existence, and that finally all thrones will be swallowed up
by this one.&nbsp; Queen Victoria is of David, and the English
throne is David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Hence all the promises and
prophecies referring to David&rsquo;s throne may be found on this
line.&nbsp; For prophecy not being of private interpretation such
facts may be proven.</p>
<h3>GENTILES.</h3>
<p>The word Gentile generally embraces all those nations and
people outside of the Twelve Tribes.&nbsp; Keeping these few
distinctions in mind, you will be enabled to read the Bible
interestingly and with the proper understanding.&nbsp; Prophetic
evidence is a strong kind of proof.&nbsp; Study the Word on this
line and you will find Providence and history lending glorious
confirmation to the same.</p>

<span class="smcap">Discourse</span> II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">ISRAEL&mdash;HOW THE GATES OF HIS ENEMIES ARE
TO BE GIVEN HIM&mdash;BY THIS SIGN LOST ISRAEL MAY BE
KNOWN&mdash;THE GIVING WILL CORRESPOND TO THE
MULTIPLYING&mdash;THE PROMISE, IN THIS DAY, IS RAPIDLY
FULFILLING&mdash;ENGLAND, DISRAELI AND &ldquo;TANCRED,&rdquo; AND
RUSSIA.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That in blessing I will bless thee; and in
multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and
as the sand which is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed shall
possess the gate of his enemies.&rdquo;&mdash;Gen. xxii. 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under a Divine oath was this prophetic promise made to
Abraham.&nbsp; At the time it was given Abraham had, by command,
offered his only son Isaac, which offering, to all human
appearance, would leave the old patriarch again childless; but
his faith staggered not, for human incompetence does not
circumscribe the bounds of Divine sufficience.&nbsp; The God who
commanded Abraham to offer, recalled the command at a certain
stage of the fulfilment, counting the faith of Abraham for
righteousness.&nbsp; In Abraham&rsquo;s faith Isaac was really
sacrificed; hence the Divine approval: &ldquo;By Myself have I
sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and
hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I
will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the
sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his
enemies.&rdquo;&nbsp; An oath with men in this day does not mean
much in the way of confirmation, but not so with God&rsquo;s
oath.&nbsp; An oath ought to be sacred, and should be the end of
doubt and strife.&nbsp; God made a promise to Abraham, and
because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself.&nbsp;
And Abraham lived to see <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the promise
begin to fulfil, and to-day the heirs of Abraham may look and see
the same promise fulfilling, for, as Paul says in Heb. vi. 17:
&ldquo;Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the
heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by
an oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who are the heirs of promise?&nbsp; For to them belong many
and precious promises, both spiritual and temporal.&nbsp;
Spiritually, they are to lead and be responsible for the
evangelisation of the world.&nbsp; Temporally, they are to be a
numerous seed, a powerful people.&nbsp; They are to occupy the
ends of the earth, the uttermost parts of the earth, the coasts
of the earth, the waste and the desolate places of the earth, the
isles of the sea, the heathen, as an inheritance.&nbsp; They are
to inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be
inhabited; they are to be the chief of nations; they are to be a
company of nations; they are to be a great people; they are to
possess the gates of their enemies.&nbsp; Surely such a people
should be found, for all these things make it impossible for them
to be hid in a corner.&nbsp; One cannot help saying with the
Psalmist: &ldquo;Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and
the people whom He hath chosen for His own
inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the English Court of Chancery are vast sums of money, large
fortunes waiting for heirs.&nbsp; The court frequently advertises
for them, and many in every land respond and are eager to prove
their claims; they are anxious to be known and accepted as the
descendants and lawful heirs of certain testators.&nbsp; It is
oftentimes difficult to establish their claims and prove
satisfactorily their identity.&nbsp; The court demands that the
evidences of heirship be very definite.&nbsp; In this they are
right.&nbsp; But we venture to say that even the English Court of
Chancery would not turn away a claimant who had all the distinct
marks and abounding evidence of identity that mark and
characterise the children of Abraham, especially so in the latter
day, for then these characteristics are to be clearer and
fuller.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>The Jews are known; they have been known all down the
centuries; they have not been able to hide themselves.&nbsp; In
keeping with the Word of God they have fulfilled up to the
present time the prophecies attaching to them.&nbsp; In all the
world they are estimated to number some nine millions.&nbsp; The
Jews include the children of Judah and Levi; these Two Tribes
only.&nbsp; The Jews themselves consent to this statement, and
allow that the descendants of Reuben, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar,
Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, and Benjamin, are lost, but
not extinct.&nbsp; They are in the world, for God has not cast
away His people for ever.&nbsp; If the Two Tribes give us nine
millions, how many should we expect the Ten Tribes to
furnish?&nbsp; Most certainly not less than forty-five
millions.&nbsp; To the Ten Tribes the special promises of
fruitfulness were given.&nbsp; To the Ten Tribes belong a greater
portion of prophecy; and in the history of the world more is
allotted to Israel than to Judah.&nbsp; Indeed, the world&rsquo;s
history pivots on the Ten Lost Tribes.</p>
<p>I believe you know the God-revealed distinction between the
words Israel and Judah.&nbsp; You know that they have a distinct
history.&nbsp; Their place and work, promises and blessings,
chastisements and rebukes, are as distinct and different as
silver and gold.</p>
<p>The spiritual heirs of Abraham are all who are embraced in the
saving and atoning covenant of grace in Christ.&nbsp; I do not
say all who believe, for there will be more in heaven without
faith than those with&mdash;namely, all those who have died
before the years of responsibility, with many of the Pagan world
who, never having heard of a Saviour, have therefore never denied
Him.&nbsp; In a spiritual sense, they are children.&nbsp; I
believe in this matter with Paul, who says, when writing to the
Romans, chap. ii.: &ldquo;There is no respect of persons with
God; for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
judged by the law.&nbsp; For when the Gentiles, which have not
the law, do by nature <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the things contained in the law,
these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves; which show
the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience
also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing,
or else excusing one another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, under the law
which governs the Pagan, I presume many will be saved and many
lost, just as under the law of the Gospel.&nbsp; In Abraham all
nations were to be blessed, spiritually.&nbsp; In this sense
Abraham&rsquo;s seed embraces persons of every age, clime, and
race.</p>
<p>But who are the seed of Abraham according to the flesh?&nbsp;
We answer, the descendants of the Twelve Tribes.&nbsp; Now to the
natural seed the Bible assigns a distinct work and place.&nbsp;
This natural seed is divided in the Bible, the word Israel
standing generally for the Ten Tribes, and Judah for Two
Tribes.&nbsp; These divisions have separate paths appointed them
to walk in through the centuries.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the House of
Israel wholly,&rdquo; &ldquo;the whole House of Israel,&rdquo;
&ldquo;all the House of Israel,&rdquo; have a special work.&nbsp;
The Ten Tribes are especially called in the Scriptures the seed
of Abraham.&nbsp; Sometimes &ldquo;My chosen,&rdquo; again
&ldquo;Mine inheritance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;My
servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; God, in referring to them in their
scattered state, and of His gathering them together, says (Isa.
xli. 8): &ldquo;But thou, Israel, art My servant, Jacob, whom I
have chosen; the seed of Abraham My friend&mdash;thou whom I have
taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief
men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art My servant; I have
chosen thee and not cast thee away.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Ten Tribes
are sometimes designated by the word Jacob.&nbsp; If we once get
a clear idea who the seed are, then we can search among the
people of the earth to find them, because in the latter day they
were to be so different from other people, and distinctly marked,
we will have no great difficulty in finding them.&nbsp; Of the
special marks, one was they were to possess the gates of their
enemies.&nbsp; The multitudinous seed and other characteristics
we will pass by for the present.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>This seed were to possess the gates of their enemies; of
this we are assured by the oath of God.&nbsp; The word gate here,
you will admit, is used in a generic sense.&nbsp; It means a
place of prominence, a position of strength, a strategetic point,
as the entrance into a city.&nbsp; Remembering that in olden
times the cities were walled around, the gate was an important
point of defence; or, as the narrow entrance into a bay, like the
entrance into New York Bay or port, the Narrows we call
them.&nbsp; Here the cities of New York and Brooklyn could best
and first be defended.&nbsp; Again, a gate in the general
vernacular means any stronghold: a tower, an island, a mountain
pass.&nbsp; Now, of this seed it is plainly stated that they
shall possess the gates of their enemies.</p>
<p>The text would be very finely illustrated if we supposed that
Mexico held Governor&rsquo;s Island, in the middle of our bay,
and defiantly dictated to us doctrines of trade, politics, and
religion.&nbsp; As arrogant and as impudent as this would seem,
yet such is the case with this seed of Abraham and other
nations.&nbsp; Believing that the Saxon race are the Ten Lost
Tribes, it then follows that the English nation is the chief
representative of these Tribes, and that they should be in
possession of the gates of their enemies.&nbsp; Are they?&nbsp;
We answer, yes.&nbsp; And every year confirms and makes more
clear the answer.&nbsp; This you say is a theory.&nbsp; Grant
it.&nbsp; You know that in science a theory is formed and then
applied.&nbsp; If you form a theory about the tides or formation
of the planets, or this world, your theory with others is applied
to known facts to see if it will fit them, to see if it will
account for them, and to see if it is in harmony with the
same.&nbsp; Now science accepts that theory which applies best,
that which accounts for facts the most reasonably, and harmonises
the most naturally.&nbsp; Such theory is then the science of the
day, and will be so accepted and so taught until it is supplanted
by a better.&nbsp; Try, then, the theory I have advanced by these
rules.</p>

30</span>Take the Islands of Jersey and Guernsey in the English
Channel, between England and France, nearer to the French shore
than England; the inhabitants, being a majority of them French,
speaking French.&nbsp; Yet when France was England&rsquo;s
greatest and most dangerous enemy, England held then, as now, the
gates of her enemies.&nbsp; Properly speaking, and adjudged by
any human rule, they belong to France&mdash;as naturally as the
island of Heligoland, at the month of the Elbe, belongs to
Germany.&nbsp; Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Suez Canal, Island of
Perim in the Straits of Babelmandeb in the Red Sea, and Socotra,
in the same sea; also Aden in the Red Sea, covering Arabia;
Peshawur, the very entrance of or from India into
Afghanistan.&nbsp; In and around the vast empire of India you
have Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, with many similar strongholds;
Rangoon, on the Irawady river, commanding and even menacing
Burmah.&nbsp; The vast empire of China is carefully guarded and
held in check by such gates as Singapore, Malacca, Penang, Hong
Kong and Cowloon.&nbsp; Sarawak in Borneo, and Labuan off the
coasts, are such gates.&nbsp; Africa is being gradually gobbled
up; her strongholds and vast areas of country are falling into
the hands of England; the coasts are fast coming under British
rule.&nbsp; Recently England has come into possession of three
gates&mdash;namely, the island of Socotra, near the Red Sea, the
island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean, and the Sublime Porte, the
lofty gateway, Constantinople.&nbsp; And it is now rumoured that
England is negotiating with Portugal for Delogoa Bay in
South-eastern Africa; price, three million dollars.&nbsp; But
this people are not satisfied with all these gates.&nbsp; They
want&mdash;and they will get what they want in a very short time,
thank Heaven; not what they deserve!&mdash;they want the famous
Khyber Pass.&nbsp; This pass is a narrow road between mountain
rocks that rise over two thousand feet at the lowest point.&nbsp;
It is some twenty-eight miles long, while for twenty-two miles
the average width is only 150 feet.&nbsp; The Eastern end the
English already hold, called the Peshawur Pass.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Afghanistan is a country in Asia.&nbsp; It is about the
size of England, 460 miles from North to South, and 430 from East
to West.&nbsp; On the North it is bounded by Turkestan, East by
India, South by Beloochistan, and West by Persia.&nbsp; The
population numbers about 7,000,000.&nbsp; They are as wild as the
country is broken and irregular.&nbsp; They are chiefly
agriculturists.&nbsp; The country is rich in minerals and
timber.&nbsp; In time past they have seldom been at peace, being
very generally at war among themselves.&nbsp; Afghan is a Persian
word, and means that which is wrapped around&mdash;no doubt
having reference to the mountain chain that hems in the whole
land.&nbsp; The people themselves, however, name their country
Vilayet, which means the land of our ancestors.&nbsp; They claim
that in their country lived Adam and his children, also Noah and
his.&nbsp; They say they had in their possession once the ark of
the covenant, but they have lost it.&nbsp; While it was with
them, if they took it into battle, victory was sure to be
theirs.&nbsp; At the present time they have Noah&rsquo;s
ark.&nbsp; It is embedded in the ground, with a portion
protruding out, which pilgrims to the top of Dera Ismael
Khan&mdash;that is, the sacred mountain of Israel&mdash;are
permitted to see and touch.&nbsp; Many have supposed the Afghans
to be the Ten Lost Tribes.&nbsp; It has been the folly of many of
the learned, in time past, to hunt for, and actually expect to
find, the chosen of God in some out-of-the-way place; to find
them few, poor, and deluded&mdash;the poorer, the fewer, and the
more wretched, the better.&nbsp; Hence, the wild Indians of the
continent, the bushmen of Africa, the aborigines of Australia,
the Laplanders of the North, and many such have been chosen of
men&mdash;though not of God.</p>
<p>The Afghan country, no doubt, once had intercourse with
Palestine.&nbsp; During Solomon&rsquo;s reign many Jews left the
land as merchants.&nbsp; Solomon built store cities in Hamath,
Tadmor in the wilderness, and many others.&nbsp; These store
cities were on the great highway which he made through the
desert, so as to <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>bring the trade of Dedan and Sheba to
Jerusalem.&nbsp; That Hebrew names are given to the mountains,
places, rivers, and persons, no one can deny; but such does not
prove them to be the Lost Tribes&mdash;it shows away back Jewish
influence and intercourse.&nbsp; They do not speak the Hebrew,
but two languages called the Pukhtu and Pushtu.&nbsp; In either
language there are few, if any, traces of the Hebrew.&nbsp; No
doubt the Lost Tribes, after being scattered into Central Asia,
when taken captive about 725 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
wandered, some of them into Afghan, and probably for a time
settled there, and gave names to the country.&nbsp; The Afghans
themselves went into the country from India, and as the Tribes
moved Westward they left the Afghans in possession.</p>
<p>The Afghan country comes now into great importance because it
is on the highway of the march of Israelitish civilisation and
progress.&nbsp; England wants it; and I predict she shall get
it.&nbsp; Russia wants it, and at present seems to have the upper
hand; but Russia or England, or the world, can avail nothing
against the purposes of Jehovah.&nbsp; The gates are promised to
Israel, therefore she will get them.&nbsp; The English have
already an army of 35,000 men in the Peshawur Valley.&nbsp;
Russia is gathering a force, and ere long the two countries will
be brought face to face.&nbsp; The end of the whole muddle will
be that England will take charge of Afghan.&nbsp; Thirty-three
years ago Disraeli wrote his novel called
&ldquo;Tancred.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this novel he makes the Queen of
England the Empress of India, and one of her favourite officers
is made Earl Beaconsfield; so far fancy has become fact.&nbsp;
But in that same novel the future of the present strife has been
set forth.&nbsp; It has been very finely put by the London
<i>Spectator</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a story going about, founded, we believe, on
good authority, that when some one quoted &lsquo;Tancred,&rsquo;
two or three months ago, in Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s presence,
the Prime Minister remarked: &lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I perceive you have
been reading &ldquo;Tancred.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>That is a
work to which I refer more and more every year&mdash;not for
amusement, but for instruction.&rsquo;&nbsp; And if anyone will
take the trouble just now to refresh his memory of
&lsquo;Tancred,&rsquo; he will see how much Lord Beaconsfield has
borrowed from it in relation to his policy.&nbsp; Turn, for
instance, to this passage: &lsquo;If I were an Arab in race as
well as in religion,&rsquo; said Tancred, &lsquo;I would not pass
my life in schemes to govern mere mountain tribes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; said the Emir, springing from
his divan, and flinging the tube of his nargileh to the other end
of the tent, &lsquo;the game is in our own hands if we have
energy.&nbsp; There is a combination which would entirely change
the whole face of the world and bring back empire to the
East.&nbsp; Though you are not the brother to the Queen of the
English, you are, nevertheless, a great English prince, and the
Queen will listen to what you say, especially if you talk to her
as you talk to me, and say such fine things in such a beautiful
voice.&nbsp; Nobody ever opened my mind like you.&nbsp; You will
magnetise the Queen as you have magnetised me.&nbsp; Go back to
England and arrange this.&nbsp; You see, gloss over it as they
may, one thing is clear, it is finished with England . . . Let
the Queen of the English collect a great fleet, let her stow away
all her treasure, bullion, plate, and precious arms; be
accompanied by all her court and chief people, and transfer the
seat of her empire from London to Delhi.&nbsp; There she will
find an immense empire ready-made, a first-rate army, and a large
revenue.&nbsp; In the meantime I will arrange with Mehemet
Ali.&nbsp; He shall have Bagdad and Mesopotamia, and pour the
Bedouin cavalry into Persia.&nbsp; I will take care of Syria and
Asia Minor.&nbsp; The only way to manage the Afghans is by Persia
and by the Arabs.&nbsp; We will acknowledge the Empress of India
as our suzerain, and secure for her the Levantine coast.&nbsp; If
she like, she shall have Alexandria, as she now has Malta.&nbsp;
It could be arranged.&nbsp; Your Queen is young.&nbsp; She has an
<i>avenir</i>.&nbsp; Aberdeen and Sir Robert Peel will never give
her this advice; their habits are formed.&nbsp; They <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>are
too old, two <i>ruses</i>.&nbsp; But you see! the greatest empire
that ever existed; besides which she gets rid of the
embarrassment of her chambers! and quite practicable!&nbsp; For
the only difficult part, the conquest of India, which baffled
Alexander, is all done.&rsquo;&nbsp; Who can avoid seeing that
Lord Beaconsfield has been quite recently referring to this
passage&mdash;&lsquo;not,&rsquo; as he said, &lsquo;for
amusement, but for instruction?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are all the
ideas of his recent policy in germ&mdash;especially the treatment
of the British Empire as having its centre of gravity in the far
East&mdash;the use of the Indian Army for conquest to be made in
Western Asia&mdash;the acquisition of the Levantine coast for
Great Britain&mdash;the active alliance between the British power
and the Mohammedan power&mdash;and last, not least, the getting
rid, to a great extent at least, by the help of Indian leverage,
of &lsquo;the embarrassment of the chambers.&rsquo;&nbsp; For the
last eight months, at least, English policy has evidently been
borrowed from &lsquo;Tancred.&rsquo;&nbsp; The monarch, for
anything we know, has been &lsquo;magnetised.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Cabinet assuredly have.&nbsp; Lord Derby and Lord Carnarvon have
been treated much as the Emir in &lsquo;Tancred&rsquo; would have
treated &lsquo;Aberdeen and Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;&mdash;thrown
aside as two &lsquo;ruses.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>England has indeed adopted an Oriental policy, and forward she
must go to execute Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose.&nbsp; Russia is
preparing on a gigantic scale.&nbsp; In Prussia the most
flourishing branch of trade among the Germans at present is the
manufacturing of arms for Russia.&nbsp; Though the late war be
over, still Russia is buying ships, and fitting them out in this
country.&nbsp; She feels bitterly her defeat through English
diplomacy: England taking Cyprus, assuming protection over
Asiatic Turkey, and making Russia yield back to Turkey 30,700
geographical miles which was contained in the original Treaty of
San Stefano.&nbsp; The following from the Government organ of
Russia will give you some idea of her chagrin.</p>
<p>The St. Petersburg <i>Golos</i> says that the Treaty of Berlin
has <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>produced an almost crushing impression on the Russian
public.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is felt that Russia has not attained her
object; that she has been deceived by her friends, and that she
has foolishly helped her enemies with her victories . . .&nbsp;
What is the reason of our failure?&nbsp; One-half per cent. of
our population have perished in the war, hundreds of millions
have been expended, and yet the Eastern Question is not solved
and the Treaty of Berlin is merely a truce.&nbsp; The last war
has clearly shown all our national peculiarities as well as our
moral and material strength . . . All the military requirements
which depended on the inbred qualities of the Russian soldier
were brilliantly carried out; but where knowledge and preparation
were demanded we were not equal to the task.&nbsp; It was
probably for this reason that we felt so much hurt on reading of
the boldness of Lord Beaconsfield, who doubtless reckoned on the
superior culture of Englishmen to that of Russians.&nbsp; All
classes of Russian society are responsible for this.&nbsp; We do
not estimate culture and knowledge at their true value.&nbsp;
Most of us say that mental work does not bring money, and that
culture is a means of corruption . . . In Western Europe, on the
other hand, people have arrived by hard experience at the
conviction that intelligence, capacity, culture, and energy,
bring men to the front, and give them peace at home and power
abroad.&nbsp; It is the knowledge of how to make the best
possible use of their energy and abilities that has enabled the
English to derive success from our victories and
sacrifices.&nbsp; May this be a lesson to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But enough; one knows the end ere they begin, for the Word of
God is true.&nbsp; We do not argue that the English are so much
smarter than other people; no, but we account for their success
because they are the executive nation of Divine Providence.&nbsp;
It falls to the lot of those who do not believe this theory to
account for their success without allowing them to be
smarter.</p>

inhabited.&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. liv. 2, 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the writings of the prophets the feminine gender is often
used when speaking of the House of Israel, and the masculine when
denoting the House of Judah.&nbsp; Quite frequently Israel is
spoken of as a divorced woman, as being cast off, and as being
barren.&nbsp; Judah remaining faithful to the throne of David and
the temple service, and abiding in the land much longer than
Israel, is presented as one married.&nbsp; So you will understand
Jeremiah iii. 8, when he says: &ldquo;And I saw, when for all the
causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put
her away, and given her a bill of divorce.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again,
Isaiah l. 1: &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, Where is the bill of
your mother&rsquo;s divorcement whom I have put
away?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, though Israel was divorced, forsaken,
cast off, and desolate, she was to have more children than
married Judah.&nbsp; So the verse preceding the text says:
&ldquo;Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
singing, and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child;
for more are the children of the desolate than the <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>children of the married wife, saith the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then come the words of the text bidding her
enlarge the place of her tent, or dwelling-place, to stretch
forth her curtains, so as to cover over the new-gotten
habitations.&nbsp; To spare not&mdash;that is, to be not tardy,
or slow&mdash;in lengthening out her cords&mdash;that is, her
influence&mdash;and strengthen her stakes&mdash;that is, her
authority; but to break forth on every hand where there is an
opening, and inherit the seed of the Gentiles, and make the
languishing and poverty-stricken cities of the nations to be
inhabited; in this conquest to go on and fear not.</p>
<p>These exhortations are given, and promises are made to Israel
after she had left Palestine.&nbsp; No one can say truthfully
that they have yet been fulfilled in no degree or sense, unless
they find such fulfilment in the conquests of the Saxon
race.&nbsp; These predictions cannot apply to the Jews, for they
are few, nationless, and without a government.&nbsp; Touching the
past history of both Judah and Israel in Palestine, we shall find
it to be barren of victories, territory, acquisition, and number,
in comparison to other nations.&nbsp; They have never occupied
the land given to Abraham in fulness.&nbsp; In Solomon&rsquo;s
time they bare rule only over a part of it.&nbsp; The Gentiles
and heathens have occupied it more and longer than the sons of
Abraham.&nbsp; But what failed to be accomplished in the past, is
held grandly in reserve for this day, the next few years.&nbsp;
God will remember His promise to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
David.&nbsp; He will remember it to fulfil it, in spite of hell
or earth.</p>
<p>We have been blind and guilty in the past, unconscious of our
origin, and as a natural consequence, ignorant of our place and
special work.&nbsp; In interpreting the Word of God we have been
lavish in spiritualising, and greedy in materialising,
overlooking the fact that nine-tenths of the Old Testament is a
material history about one people, and that through them
God&rsquo;s special providence was to flow to all other nations;
and the New Testament plants the life and prosperity of the
Gentile <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>world upon the course and progress of
Israel.&nbsp; God said to Abraham, &ldquo;In thee shall all the
families of the earth be blessed:&rdquo; and more, &ldquo;and in
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Israel, being scattered and cast off,
became a blessing to the world.&nbsp; They gave to the
surrounding nations the only true idea of God, for in their
lowest condition and idolatry they preserved the name and
knowledge of Jehovah, and Christ sent His disciples after them
through one of their own Tribe&mdash;namely,
Benjamin&mdash;telling them not to go into the way of the
Gentiles, nor into the cities of the Samaritans, &ldquo;but go
rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
these sheep Christ declares He was sent.&nbsp; Where were these
sheep?&nbsp; They were scattered about in Central Asia&mdash;in
Scriptural language in Cappadocia, Galatia, Pamphylia, Lydia,
Bithynia, and round about Illyricum.&nbsp; From these very
regions came the Saxons: from here they spread abroad North and
West, being the most Christian of any people on the face of the
earth then, as well as now.&nbsp; Their reception of the Gospel
gave them power over the surrounding nations, to whom they were,
as it had been foretold, witnesses for Jesus and providence in a
very special manner.&nbsp; What then, we say with Paul, will be
the blessing of Israel&mdash;recognized and fully restored to
God&rsquo;s favour?&nbsp; If so much good was carried and
bestowed upon the Gentile nations because Israel was scattered,
how much, and what are the blessings in store for those nations
when Israel and Judah be restored?&nbsp; Paul compares it to a
resurrection&mdash;like as when the barrenness and desolation of
a Winter is supplanted by the fruits and beauties of
Summer.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the casting away of them be the
reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be,
but life from the dead?&rdquo; (Rom. xi. 15).</p>
<p>It is reasonable to suppose that this world is subject to the
providence of God.&nbsp; Such a supposition is grandly sustained
by the laws and operations of nature without, and the experience
and intuitions of the mind within; and I believe this providence
<!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>to be all-comprehensive, bounding, and cognising all
things, past, present, and future, both small and great; claiming
the ages for its measure, the universe for the field of its
operations, and the Infinite as the source of power.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lord Jehovah reigns, let the earth
rejoice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me persuade you to thoroughly believe
in the precision, the intimacy, and the completeness of this
providence.&nbsp; This doctrine we need to fully learn and
accept.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and
the earth,&rdquo; and it is He &ldquo;who hath measured the
waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with a
span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and
weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
balance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Aye, and more, yet closer still does this
providence approach us in our affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Him kings
reign and princes decree judgment.&nbsp; He bringeth the princes
to nothing; He maketh the judges of the earth as
vanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even closer yet, for without His permission
a sparrow cannot fall to the ground; and so intimate is He with
us, that He knoweth the number of the hairs of the head.&nbsp;
Now all this kind of Bible instruction is intended to teach the
nearness of God to us, and His interest and intimacy with nations
and nature.&nbsp; Let us not think for a moment that nations can
rush to war and be outside this circle of providence.&nbsp; Let
us study to know God&rsquo;s mind, His plans and purposes with
the nations; for rest satisfied that His plan will finally be
accepted by men and nations, and His purposes will prevail.&nbsp;
Kings may plan, diplomatists may diplomatise, scientists may
analyse, theologians may teach and preach their isms, and
politicians may make platforms and construct rings, yet none, nor
all combined, can stay the hand of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;He doeth
according to His will in the armies of heaven and among the
inhabitants of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He can initiate, permit,
modify, and destroy.&nbsp; Once we truly recognise the
sovereignty of God over us, conceit will lie dead at the feet of
humility.</p>
<p>The Church at large has but a slender hold upon this great
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>doctrine.&nbsp; They look upon the great movement of
wars and strife, rising and falling of nations, as looks the
country stranger upon a railway engine the first time, the
whirling wheels, the steam and smoke and burnished boiler rivet
his attention so completely, that he sees not the driver in his
car.&nbsp; So men are dazed with the show of pomp of courts and
councils, with the harangues of legislators and march of
regiments, that they discern not the master hand behind that
directs all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, Thou art a God that hidest
Thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, no, friends; English bravery, nor
American ingenuity will not account for all that England has done
on the line of victories, and the marvellous and rapid growth of
these United States.&nbsp; As God said long ago through Moses, so
He could say to-day&mdash;for heavenly counsel was given to the
children of Israel on entering the Promised Land, with a design
of suppressing their pride and enabling them to form a correct
idea of their success in driving the strong and greater nations
of Canaanites and Philistines&mdash;&ldquo;Speak not thou in
thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out from
before thee saying: For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me
in to possess this land; but for the wickedness of these nations
the Lord doth drive them out from before thee.&nbsp; Not for thy
righteousness, or the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to
possess the land, but for the wickedness of those nations the
Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, that He may
perform the word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.&nbsp; Understand, therefore, that the Lord thy
God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy
righteousness, for thou art a stiff-necked people&rdquo; (Deut.
ix. 4).</p>
<p>By the same rule and for the very same reason that Israel
conquered Palestine, does England go on from conquest to
conquest.&nbsp; And because God remembered to perform His
promises made to the patriarchs upon their seed, America was <!--
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>opened for the Puritans, who are without doubt the
descendants and representatives of Manasseh, of whom God said
&ldquo;he should be a people, a great people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rule of England and America over other people, is to be as
life from the dead&mdash;that is, whatsoever country England
conquers and rules, it is better for the people, and the country,
and the world.&nbsp; They give to the people a liberty that they
would not have given to themselves; they develop the resources of
the country as never before, and by trade and commerce bless the
people and cause them to be a blessing unto others.&nbsp; And
better still, they make known to the conquered ones, in due time,
the riches of faith in Christ.&nbsp; So we have no hesitation in
saying, a thing patent to every unprejudiced observer, that the
aborigines of the conquered colonies of Great Britain are treated
better by their conquerors than they ever treated
themselves.&nbsp; The Africans, in the conquered colonies of
Africa, are better off under British rule than those colonies or
portions unconquered are.&nbsp; The hosts of India enjoy more,
fare better in every grace and virtue in all that goes to adorn
and develop mankind, under the British government and protection
than they ever did or would under self-government.&nbsp; So the
French, Germans, Italians, Russians, Spaniards, and the numerous
progeny of emigrants to this country, fare better in every way
with Manasseh, than they did in their own lands.&nbsp; Of course,
both in England&rsquo;s rule and America&rsquo;s, there are many
defects; but taking all in all, the good will out-weigh the bad;
and more so as the years roll on.</p>
<p>True, an arbitrary purpose and an individualism is seen on the
surface, yet under it all there is the hand of God.&nbsp; The
farmer is free as to what he sows, but the Divine, without
interfering with his freedom, regulates the harvest to plenty or
famine.&nbsp; The Saxon people, England and America, stand in a
new light to the world by the teachings of the Bible.&nbsp; Being
Israel or the Ten Lost Tribes, they become at once the chosen
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>agents of God for the glorious purpose of evangelising
the whole world, and finally, by reducing the whole earth to the
plane of universal liberty and peace.</p>
<p>It was necessary that these two nations should first be taught
the art of mediation, for the ends of peace; that they should
learn and show to the world that national disputes and grievances
can be settled without an appeal to the sword.&nbsp; Hence we
have, and what is much better, the world has, Geneva and Alabama
and the fish bounty treaty of Canada and the United States.&nbsp;
Not all the press did on either side, nor all the carping and
blustering of individuals, could prevent the happy consummation
of both these treaties.&nbsp; To God be praise, for they are
prophetic harbingers of a better day coming.</p>
<p>No hand nor power, nor combination of powers, can stop the
onward march of Israel to her God-ordained goal.&nbsp; Her future
is to spread on the right hand and on the left.&nbsp; Island
after island, colony after colony, will fall into her hands for
mutual benefit.&nbsp; Russia may contest this march, and will,
for she is as much the appointed agent of contest from Heaven as
England is to advance.&nbsp; In a few years she will try to take
the place of England among the nations, as she has just done in
Afghan.&nbsp; Russia promised, no doubt, that she would and could
protect the Ameer against England, but the bargain was outside of
the aims of Providence, hence it could not be sustained.&nbsp; It
is ordained of Heaven that Afghan fall into the hands of England,
if England be Israel.</p>
<p>Against this fate-like division of the world Russia is going
to contend and fight whenever she gets a chance.&nbsp; It would
pay Russia and many other countries to read that &ldquo;When the
Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when He
separated the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the people
according to the children of Israel&rdquo; (Deut. xxxii.
8).&nbsp; These bounds God will maintain wherever they run;
whatever country they cut in two, no matter, the earth must
finally conform to <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>this Divine geography.&nbsp; This
purpose is strongly set forth by Isaiah xliv. 7: &ldquo;And who,
as I, shall call and shall declare it, and set it in order for
Me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are
coming and shall come.&rdquo;&nbsp; This same sturdy fact is
taught by Paul when speaking to the Athenians, telling them that
God &ldquo;hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on
the face of the earth, <i>and hath determined the times before
appointed</i>, <i>and the bounds of their
habitations</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; National destinies are not so much
things of chance, or prizes for the sword, as many think.&nbsp;
God promised to David, when both Israel and Judah were
prosperously settled in Palestine under David&rsquo;s reign, that
He would appoint a place for His people Israel, and plant them
there, and they should not be moved, neither should the wicked
afflict them, as aforetime (2 Sam. vii. 10.)&nbsp; This promise
God has kept.&nbsp; He has given them the British Isles, where
none can afflict them, as they were wont to do when Israel was
scattered in Asia and Europe.&nbsp; God has found Manasseh a home
in this land of blessings and rich acres.</p>
<p>England, by a necessity, was forced to find new countries to
provide for her multiplying population.&nbsp; Then she is forced
to enter other nations as a missionary.&nbsp; She, with Manasseh,
is chiefly responsible for the evangelisation of the world, and
of course they are at work all over the world, for England and
the United States send out more missionaries than all the world
beside.&nbsp; Russia needs no land for colonisation, for now her
inhabitants number only thirty-four to the square mile, while
England numbers 889.&nbsp; If we take in all the territory under
Russia and England, even then England has more to the square mile
than Russia.&nbsp; Russia comprises about 8,000,000 square miles,
and England, with her late additions, leaving out the United
States, numbers about 9,000,000.&nbsp; Joining Ephraim and
Manasseh together, they own one-fourth of the whole
world&mdash;namely, about 13,000,000 square miles; <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the
whole earth numbers 51,340,800 square miles.&nbsp; Besides,
Russia is not a missionary country.&nbsp; She neither sends any,
nor accepts any, being at present the only nation closed to
missionary operation and toleration.&nbsp; The past few years
Russia has gained rapidly in territorial power.&nbsp; With the
conquest of Bokhara and portions of Turkestan, or Independent
Tartary, she has added some 800,000 square miles.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the last century the Russian advance forts
were 2,500 miles distant from those of England.&nbsp; At the
close of the century the distance was 2,000.&nbsp; Then in 1810
it was reduced to 1,000.&nbsp; And since 1855 it has been reduced
to 400.&nbsp; And now, of course, they want it reduced to nothing
by getting control of Afghan.</p>
<p>How wonderfully clear are the fulfilling events of the
prophecy.&nbsp; This king of the North is to become a strong
king, who, when Israel and Judah are settled in Palestine, will
have spirit and power to attack them.&nbsp; So he is ripening,
growing, and gathering power ready.&nbsp; Russia now comprises
nine crowns, eight of which are crowns of conquest.&nbsp;
Russia&rsquo;s one grand desire is to possess Palestine,
especially Jerusalem.&nbsp; The Crimean war was waged for rights
and extended privileges in this holy city.&nbsp; To-day Russian
pilgrims swarm thither by the thousands every year.&nbsp; A few
years ago she built outside the Jaffa gate what she called an
hospice, which was designed to be nothing more nor less than a
fort.&nbsp; It is in a position commanding the whole city, and is
a place of great strength.&nbsp; Often she has tried to possess
the city and land.&nbsp; By-and-bye she will be permitted by
Providence to pour her troops into this &ldquo;land of unwalled
villages,&rdquo; and when having nearly achieved the ambitious
plan of ages, and nearly realised her one great national idea,
she will perish, to rise no more, &ldquo;on the mountains of
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her history is set forth by Ezekiel xxxviii.
and xxxix. chapters.</p>
<p>Palestine and Jerusalem have borne undeniable evidence for
prophecy and Providence.&nbsp; The whole land and the Book have
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>been wonderfully agreed during the past eighteen
centuries.&nbsp; How significant and telling the wailings and
lamentations of the devout Jews, who crowd under the walls of the
mosque of Omar, the site of the ancient temple.&nbsp; Here, each
returning Sabbath, groups of Jews may be heard dolefully crying:
&ldquo;<i>Ali bene</i>, <i>Ali bene</i>; <i>bene bethka</i>;
<i>bekarob</i>, <i>bimheira</i>, <i>bimheira</i>;
<i>beyamenue</i>, <i>bekarob</i>,&rdquo; which, being
interpreted, means, &ldquo;Lord build, Lord build; build Thy
house speedily, in haste, in haste; even in our day build Thy
house speedily.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, mourning brethren of Judah, the
time is coming when the house shall be built and the voice of
wailing no more heard in the streets.</p>
<p>Can any student or inquirer after the truth fail to see that
in our day a prophecy is being fulfilled?&nbsp; Can any one shut
their eyes to the wonderful fact that Israel is breaking forth on
the left and on the right?&nbsp; God has long ago said that
Israel were the people of His inheritance, and that Jacob was the
lot of His inheritance, or His girdle, or cord, as the word lot
means.&nbsp; Then, if you turn your attention to Great Britain
and her colonies, including Manasseh, you will see this girdle or
measuring line around the earth.&nbsp; Let me aid you by pointing
the same out for you.&nbsp; Look at the Eastern hemisphere
circle, enclosing the Gentile nations.&nbsp; Begin with Great
Britain; pass on to the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, Malta,
Cyprus, West Coast African Colonies, St. Helena, Cape Colonies,
Mauritius, Seychelles, Perim, Aden, Ceylon, India, Burmah,
Straits Settlements, Labuan, Australian Colonies, Hong Kong, and
the Dominion of Canada.&nbsp; In the Western hemisphere commence
the circle with Canada and United States, Fiji Islands, New
Zealand, Falkland Islands, British Guiana, British Honduras, West
India Islands, and Newfoundland.&nbsp; Do we not plainly see that
Israel is possessing &ldquo;the isles of the sea,&rdquo;
&ldquo;coasts of the earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;waste and desolate
places?&rdquo;&nbsp; These things are not hid in a corner; they
proclaim the intentions of God, an over-ruling Providence; and
who and where the Lost Tribes are.&nbsp; A miracle and prophecy
are fulfilling before our eyes.</p>

was said unto them, Ye are not My people, there it shall be said
unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.&rdquo;&mdash;Hosea
i. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A period of time is frequently referred to in the Scriptures
as being the &ldquo;latter days.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, therefore,
very important for the prophetic student, and the Church of
Christ at large, that the time of days spoken of should be
known.&nbsp; For connected with these days are a number of
prophecies waiting fulfilment, and they are of such a nature that
their fulfilment may easily be discerned.&nbsp; In breadth and
scope they cover much territory and include many people.&nbsp;
They cannot be hid in a corner, for the parts are so numerous and
the interests so great.&nbsp; The fulfilment of these prophecies
will make a radical and fundamental change in Church and
State.</p>
<p>I take it for granted we are now entering into the time of the
latter days&mdash;a time that precedes by a natural consequence
the millennium.&nbsp; It is, therefore, unwise on the part of any
person to claim that Christ may come any day, and that His
millennial reign may be begun at any moment.&nbsp; It is but fair
that we should carefully consider our bearings in the circle of
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Providence and our position in the ages.&nbsp; The story
and work of redemption are grand, full of interest and thrilling
incidents; still we must take things in their order.&nbsp; Some
stories we read are very fascinating.&nbsp; The plot culminates,
the characters and incidents converge toward and centre in the
hero.&nbsp; At such a point we are often carried away with our
sympathy for the hero; we become anxious for him, and desires to
know the issues, and so are tempted to skip a few pages and get
at the end unwisely and unlawfully.&nbsp; Thus I think many are
carried away by a loving desire for the millennium; they become
anxious for the return of the Hero of redemption; they skip a few
pages of Providence, and come to the end too soon.</p>
<p>These days are preparative, and in such a preparative stage we
are warranted to look for the fulfilment of certain prophecies;
for prophecies, indeed, of such a nature and character that no
Bible student need be mistaken as to the time, place, and
conditions of fulfilment.&nbsp; We have called your attention to
one of these prophecies, and pointed out to you how the same was
literally fulfilling before the eyes of all.&nbsp; God, in olden
times, made promises to Abraham, the patriarchs, and their
seed.&nbsp; These promises were nothing more nor less than
prophecies.&nbsp; He attested the same by His own oath.&nbsp; He
called to witness the sun, moon, stars, sea, night, day, the
seasons, seedtime and harvest.&nbsp; These He called His
ordinances.&nbsp; These ordinances may depart from before Him,
but the seed of Israel should not cease to be a nation.&nbsp;
They were not only to be a nation, but a company of
nations.&nbsp; To this end, in the latter days, they were to come
in possession of the isles of the sea, the coasts of the earth,
waste and desolate places; to inherit the seed of the Gentiles,
and cause their desolate cities to be filled.&nbsp; They were to
possess and rule over the heathen.&nbsp; In the latter days they
were to possess Edom and Esau&mdash;that is, Turkey&mdash;and so
come in possession of their own land, Palestine.&nbsp; Now I call
you to <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>witness, and ask you if these things
are so?&nbsp; Before your eyes, before mine, before the eyes of
all the world, God is fulfilling His promises made to the
fathers.</p>
<p>The very exceptions to the sweeping and comprehensive
possessions of the seed of Jacob are pyramidal witnesses to the
same.&nbsp; The House of Judah was to become homeless, without a
nation and without a government, after they left Palestine; but
to be a people known by the race feature, and by their unwavering
adherence, attachment, and fidelity to the Mosaic worship.&nbsp;
This exception all can see, and none can truthfully deny.&nbsp;
They have had money and men enough to buy and rule a nation, but
as yet they have none.&nbsp; Their talent, their ability, and
their money, have been the chief factor in the rule, prosperity,
and greatness of many nations in the past as well as now.&nbsp;
And the second conception is not less grand and conclusive.&nbsp;
Let any one inquire what was to be the portion of the Tribe of
Manasseh, and they will find that Manasseh was to be a distinct
people, a great people; for so said the dying patriarch
Jacob.&nbsp; Now such a people, a great people, we hold Manasseh
to be at this day in the people of the United States.&nbsp; Some
sixty colonies England has overrun, established, or conquered,
and she is busy at work yet conquering and gathering in.&nbsp;
But is it not remarkable that she has never lost one of the many
save the United States?&nbsp; Will any one give an earthly reason
for this marvellous exception?&nbsp; I presume no one can.&nbsp;
There is, however, a Divine reason.&nbsp; Moses, when giving his
prophetic benediction to the Tribes of Israel, gives us an
insight into this question.&nbsp; Speaking of Joseph and the
wonderful blessing in store for his sons Ephraim and Manasseh, he
says: &ldquo;His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and
his horns are like the horns of unicorns; and with them he shall
push the people together to the ends of the earth; <i>and they
are the ten thousands of Ephraim</i>, <i>and they are the
thousands of Manasseh</i>&rdquo; (Deut, xxxiii. 17).&nbsp; And
further light is thrown on this <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>subject when
we notice what Isaiah says in the forty-ninth chapter.&nbsp; The
children of Israel, when settled in some Isles, would lose a
portion of themselves, and still the &ldquo;children which thou
shalt have <i>after thou hast lost the other</i>, shall say again
in thine ears, The place is too strait for me, give place to me
that I may dwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The simple and natural
interpretation of such a passage is, that the Isles referred to
were the British Isles.&nbsp; The children lost refer to
Manasseh, the Pilgrims, and Puritans who came from England.&nbsp;
And the cry for more room after they have left, shall lead
England to look for lands in which to colonise her surplus
population, all of which she has done and is doing.</p>
<p>Surely in these things there is something more than
chance.&nbsp; Yes, there is a divine purpose fulfilled.&nbsp;
Seeing, then, that God will put the land into Israel&rsquo;s
hand, there will run another blessing parallel with
this&mdash;namely, a peculiar increase of the seed, or children
of Israel, so that they may occupy and control these lands.&nbsp;
These two prophecies are to be fulfilling on a parallel line at
the same time.&nbsp; Are they so fulfilling?&nbsp; We answer,
Yes; and the answer all the world may verify, for the facts are
of such a nature that if they are not so fulfilling it can be
very easily disproved.</p>
<p>The prophet tells us in the text that the children of Israel
are to be numerous&mdash;to be numerous in an extraordinary
degree&mdash;so much so that it shall appear partly miraculous
when such increase is compared to other people or judged by the
common methods of reasoning.&nbsp; Hosea had three children; the
first a son.&nbsp; He called him Jezreel.&nbsp; This son was set
for a witness that God would cause to cease the House of Israel
in Palestine&mdash;that Israel should cease to be a nation for a
time.&nbsp; This idea Isaiah points out under the type of an
abandoned wife.&nbsp; God styles Himself the Husband of Israel,
and that He had given the wife a bill of divorcement.&nbsp; Thus
the two prophets agree, and history ratifies both.</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Hosea&rsquo;s second child he calls Lo-Ruhamah.&nbsp;
She was set for a witness that God would take away His mercy from
the House of Israel for a time, and that God would utterly take
them away out of the land.&nbsp; So He did; for a few years after
this we find the children of Israel were carried captive into
Assyria by Shalmaneser, and the Assyrians were brought and put in
their place.&nbsp; And from these Assyrians, who were planted in
the cities and country left by the children of Israel, we get the
Samaritans, who were, as you see, not Jews nor Israelites by
generation&mdash;they were manufactured Jews only.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the Lord removed Israel out of His sight, as He had
said by all His servants the prophets.&nbsp; So was Israel
carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this
day&rdquo; (2 Kings xvii. 23).&nbsp; During this captivity, which
is even in force till now, barren Israel, the divorced one, was
to have more children than the married one&mdash;namely,
Judah.</p>
<p>We find that the third child born to Hosea is called Lo-ammi,
meaning, &ldquo;Ye are not My people.&rdquo;&nbsp; This child
pro-figured the casting out of the Jews; that they would refuse
to accept God in Christ, and He therefore would reject
them.&nbsp; Thus the Jews became wanderers from their own
land.&nbsp; And the land rests in desolation, enjoying her
Sabbath of rest, while her sons and daughters are being chastised
and trained for their return.</p>
<p>The time will come when God will call Israel to Him, and have
mercy upon her, when the divorced one shall be restored to her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it shall be at that day, saith the
Lord, that thou shalt call Me Ishi, and shalt call me no more
Baali&rdquo; (Hos. ii. 16).&nbsp; Now Ishi means husband, and
Baali stands for Lord.&nbsp; Saxons have been looked upon as
being infidels by the rest of the world.&nbsp; The Mohammedans
and Buddhists never reckoned the Saxons as being the sons of God;
and Catholic Europe and Greek Russia have looked upon England as
infidel and heretical.&nbsp; And the Saxons themselves never went
so far in their knowledge as to know who they were, their origin
and <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>work.&nbsp; But the prophet says: &ldquo;It shall come
to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not
My people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of
the living God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the time will come when
Lo-Ruhamah shall become Ru-hamah, which means to have obtained
mercy.&nbsp; And Lo-Ammi shall become Ammi, which means that this
is My people.&nbsp; And Jezreel, which was a sign of dispersion,
shall be the sign of gathering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall the
children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered
together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up
out of the land; <i>for great shall be the day of
Jezreel</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the Jews (Ammi) will call the
Saxons their sister, long lost, but found at last.&nbsp; The
Saxons (Ru-hamah) will call the Jews their brother, those whom in
the past they have hated and persecuted; and thought themselves
far removed from Jewish blood.&nbsp; Now they both will
acknowledge a common generation, and Abraham their father.&nbsp;
And one with his eyes half open can see this part of the prophecy
fulfilling.&nbsp; The Jews, England, and United States, from this
and henceforth, are one in interest, policy, and destiny.</p>
<p>These being the latter days, let us look for the signs of the
multiplying of the seed so that they be as the sea sands God
promised to Abraham, saying: &ldquo;That in blessing I will bless
thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of
heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed
shall possess the gate of his enemies&rdquo; (Gen. xxii.
17).&nbsp; Old Jacob foretold that Joseph would be a fruitful
bough, whose branches would run over the wall&mdash;that is,
colonise.&nbsp; This increase is to be seen in two ways.&nbsp;
Let me direct your attention to one of these ways, in a special
manner, because it is so singular and unique, so distinct and
discernable.&nbsp; In Jeremiah xxx. 10, 11, we find a remarkable
statement: &ldquo;Fear not, O Israel, for I am with thee, saith
the Lord, to save thee.&nbsp; Though I make a full end of all
nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full
end of thee; but I will correct <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>thee in
measure, and will not leave thee altogether
unpunished.&rdquo;&nbsp; That Israel has been punished and
corrected no one will deny who is acquainted with her history and
sojourn from the time she was carried captive to this day.&nbsp;
But has the other part of the saying been fulfilled?&nbsp; We
answer, Yes&mdash;as the law of colonisation has
progressed.&nbsp; The Ancient Britons are no more; Saxon Israel
has entirely supplanted them, just as Manasseh in the United
States is supplanting the aborigines or Indians.&nbsp; They
perish and disappear like snow before the rising sun.&nbsp; Not
all we can do on the line of legislation, philanthropy, and
religion, is sufficient to stay the ravages of this long-ago
declared decree of Heaven.&nbsp; Go to Canada, and you find they
are perishing; in Newfoundland they are entirely gone, and in
every other province they are fast disappearing, save such as are
saved by incorporation, by marriage, and salt stayed by the power
of Christianity; but both these remedies are only
temporal&mdash;they perish in spite of all in the heated
atmosphere of Israel&rsquo;s civilisation.&nbsp; Some few tribes
may hold their own and seem to increase, but such does not
invalidate the evidence of the decree.&nbsp; For they have
perished in such numbers, and so uniformly, when in contact with
Israel, that history proclaims the decree fulfilled.</p>
<p>The native inhabitants of Van Dieman, called Tasmanians, have
entirely become extinct.&nbsp; The Maories of New Zealand are
rapidly diminishing.&nbsp; Fifty years ago they were 200,000
strong; now only about 50,000.&nbsp; In a few more years they
will be gone.&nbsp; The same is true in all the other Australian
provinces.&nbsp; The same is true of many isles of the sea, also
of the African colonies.&nbsp; In these things, so exceptional,
we can surely say, with the magicians of old who contended
against Moses, &ldquo;This is the finger of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus we see Israel increasing, by the law of diminution going on
among the Gentiles.&nbsp; Israel in the latter day was to be
blessed with plenty in the orchards, stall, and field: &ldquo;For
I will lay no more famine upon you, saith the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>The past year we learn that some 10,000,000 of Chinese
perished in famine.&nbsp; India, in one part, has been greatly
reduced in number by the same scourge.&nbsp; This country will be
partly protected from the operation of this law&mdash;for no
doubt a large portion are from Abraham.&nbsp; &ldquo;But unto the
sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts,
and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
Eastward, unto the East country&rdquo; (Gen. xxv. 6).&nbsp; This
same scourge does not follow the colonising of other
nations.&nbsp; It did not follow Spain, nor the Dutch, nor
France.</p>
<p>If you turn to the prophets, you will soon learn how they are
to increase in the latter days&mdash;not by a comparison on the
line of diminution only, but in and from themselves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will sow the
House of Israel and the House of Judah with the seed of man and
beast&rdquo; (Jer. xxxi. 27).&nbsp; Have these days come?&nbsp;
We again say, Yes; and these kind of prophecies are being
fulfilled in this day in so special a manner as to make certain
the times we live in.&nbsp; Through Israel, Judah, and Manasseh,
the earth is to find the equilibrium of peace.&nbsp; The Jews
will furnish the money, for in the increasing ascendancy, and
multiplying power, and authority of England and America, the Jews
will draw closer to them and invest more and more their money
with them, because of greater security and profit.&nbsp; The
balance of power and even compulsion will be in the hands of
England and America, to force arbitration on disputing nations,
and they will do so, having set the precedents themselves in the
Alabama and fish treaties.&nbsp; At present, many will refuse
this idea, and point to the famous Monroe doctrine.&nbsp; Now
that doctrine has had its time, nearly; and it has served a good
purpose for the country.&nbsp; The mercantile growth, and general
producing power of this country, will cause us to abandon our
selfish protection policy; for of all other people on the face of
the earth we will want free trade; for we will have the greatest
surplus of mercantile and <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>agricultural
productions, and in a short time our very position and ability
will push away all competitors.&nbsp; Once our mercantile and
agricultural interests are cast in other nations, we will then
have an interest in their wars and peace, and will be led to
interfere.</p>
<p>The chief way in which the balance of power will fall into
English and American hands is in the fulfilling of the blessings
of the text: the multiplying of this people, first by natural
increase, and second by incorporation and absorption.&nbsp; Look
at this law of absorption; how vigorous and sure!&nbsp; If you
turn into a field of grass fowls, pigs, horses, and cows, you get
chicken-meat, pork, horseflesh, and beef.&nbsp; The individualism
in each creature absorbs and converts the same field of grass
into themselves.&nbsp; So into this country are coming people of
every nation and race, but the individualism of Manasseh will in
due time make them all Manassehites.&nbsp; The children of the
Russians, Poles, Spanish, and so on, become American in taste,
manners, and sympathies.&nbsp; They are being grafted into the
tree of Manasseh.</p>
<p>But look at the law of increase naturally.&nbsp; Take the
population of several countries as given in the last census, and
carefully note the relative increase, and how long it takes each
nation to double its number.&nbsp; Russia, eighty-six millions,
doubles every 100 years; Germany, forty-two millions, doubles
every 100 years; Turkey, forty-seven millions, doubles every 550
years; Austria, thirty-seven millions, doubles every 100 years;
France, thirty-six millions, doubles every 140 years; Great
Britain, thirty-three millions, doubles every 55 years; United
States, forty millions, doubles every 25 years; Italy,
twenty-seven millions, doubles every 125 years; Egypt, seventeen
millions, doubles every 150 years; Spain, sixteen millions,
doubles every 112 years; English colonies, ten millions, doubles
every 25 years.&nbsp; Now make a calculation for 100 years, from
1878 to 1978, and see how these countries stand in population
<!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>and their relative position.&nbsp; Russia will have one
hundred and seventy-two millions; Germany, eighty-four; Turkey,
fifty-six; Austria, seventy-four; France, fifty-nine; Great
Britain, one hundred and thirty-seven; Italy, forty-one; Egypt,
twenty-nine; Spain, twenty-eight; United States, six hundred and
forty; and the English colonies, one hundred and sixty&mdash;and
that is not reckoning the natives in the colonies, only the
descendants of the English.&nbsp; Of course, in a country like
India, the natives will be a considerable number, and they might
properly be reckoned in with the colonial items, and so swell the
number of Israel&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>Now these figures show a wonderful conclusion.&nbsp; In simple
language, we find that in 1978, the English-speaking race, or
Israelites, will number 937 millions, while all of Russia,
Germany, Turkey, Austria, France, Italy, Egypt, and Spain, will
only number 543 millions.&nbsp; Where then, we ask, will be the
balance of power?&nbsp; And why should this certain law come into
operation at this time, if it be not the blessing foretold by the
prophets?&nbsp; And can we not see that these are the latter
days, and that God is fulfilling His promises to Israel?</p>
<p>The blood of Abraham and the faith of Abraham have been
wonderfully preserved and projected down through the centuries
with telling effect.&nbsp; And on this line the Darwinian theory
of election is very true, for the survival of the fittest is the
proclaimed law of Heaven.&nbsp; There is power in land possession
and there is power in number, and if these two factors maintain
their force for one hundred years, then we infer of certainty
that the sceptre of rule and destiny of the world will be in the
hands of Israel, unless the laws of nature are reversed, and the
promises of God fail.&nbsp; The Word of God cannot fail or return
unto Him void; it must accomplish that whereunto He sent it and
prosper in things designed, or as Jeremiah xxiii. 20 says:
&ldquo;The anger of the Lord shall not return until He has
executed and till He has performed the thoughts of His heart; in
the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the last two discourses we called your attention to two
prophecies that are now fulfilling; they are on parallel lines of
time and territory.&nbsp; The first had reference to the rapid
accumulation of the lands of the earth by Israel.&nbsp; Accepting
the Anglo-Saxons as being the children and descendants of Jacob,
it naturally follows that the prophetic blessings and promises
made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their heirs, should find a
fulfilment in these, the latter days, and that such fulfilment
should be found in the English nation, among the Jews, and in the
United States.&nbsp; It is easy to see and believe that the
curses prophetically pronounced on Judah and Israel have been
fulfilled, especially on the House of Judah.&nbsp; The promises
to the House of Israel are now being grandly realised.&nbsp;
England is in possession of the isles of the sea, the coasts of
the earth, the waste and desolate places, the heathen is her
inheritance, and she is inheriting the seed of the Gentiles, and
causing their desolate cities to be inhabited.&nbsp; From the
taking of Jamaica, by General Penn, in 1655, to the peaceful
cession of Cyprus, the course of this little island nation has
been onward and upward.&nbsp; And if her conquests and progress
are not amenable to prophecy, for an interpretation, then the
wonder is still greater.&nbsp; The facts are with us, and must be
accounted for some way.&nbsp; The second had reference to the
multitudinous seed of <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Israel in the latter days.&nbsp; Till
two hundred years ago the Anglo-Saxons were not in this respect
distinct from other races; indeed, for centuries they were
distinct rather for their weakness in multiplying power and
number.&nbsp; Many other races have exceeded them in this
particular.&nbsp; But no sooner do we come abreast of the latter
day time than we find the laws of centuries changed.&nbsp; In
thermal science it is an axiom that heat expands all bodies, and
of course that cold contracts them.&nbsp; But to this general
rule there is one beautiful and benevolent exception: it is in
water; for if we start with water at thirty-two degrees, we find
the remarkable phenomenon of cold expanding all below thirty-two,
and heat expanding all above.&nbsp; If we take water at 212
degrees and withdraw it from the heat, it will continue to
contract till we reach thirty-two; then the law is reversed, and
the water expands.&nbsp; Now the reversion of this law, at this
particular point, is wonderfully expressive of Divine forethought
and benevolence.&nbsp; By such a change ice is made to float in
water, and so save our lakes, streams, and wells from being
frozen solid.&nbsp; As this exception is to thermal science, so
is the law of reproduction to Israel in this day.&nbsp; This
people, who have been behind other races, now, at an appointed
time, step to the front.&nbsp; The law seems to be reversed, and
that too for a benevolent purpose&mdash;for the very purpose that
they might be able to fulfil the mission assigned them in these
last days, to occupy the new lands and evangelise the
world.&nbsp; One prophecy seems to call for the other, for what
would be the use of the lands without the people, or the people
without the lands?&nbsp; It is an amazing fact that Queen
Victoria should bear rule over one-third of the population of the
whole earth, and that Israel, including Manasseh, should own
one-fourth of the land.</p>
<p>But this amazing fact is made reasonable when we accept the
Queen as being of the seed of David, and an heir to the promises
attaching to David&rsquo;s throne, and when we accept the <!--
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Anglo-Saxons as being the Ten Lost Tribes of
Israel.&nbsp; Then prophecy, Providence, and facts, are a
trinity&mdash;they are one sublime whole.&nbsp; God, speaking
through Moses, said He would punish to reform Israel for seven
times&mdash;and seven times prophetically understood, means 2,520
years.&nbsp; If we allow that Israel were carried captive in the
year 725 before Christ, then Israel would come into freedom, or
be reformed, about 1795; because if we add 725 to 1,795, we get
2,520.&nbsp; Up to this point they were to be robbed of their
children and to be few in number (see Lev. xxvi. 22).&nbsp; In
the year 1795 Israel were to be relieved from these curses; and
about this time this special law of reproduction came into
operation; or, if we take the lamentations of Hosea vi.
1&ndash;3: &ldquo;Come and let us return unto the Lord, for He
hath torn, and He will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind
us up; after two days will He revive us; in the third day He will
raise us up, and we shall live in His sight.&nbsp; Then shall we
know if we follow on to know the Lord.&nbsp; His going forth is
prepared as the morning, and He shall come unto us as the rain,
as the latter and former rain unto the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
this passage, our day and the special providences of this period
are mournfully and graphically referred to.&nbsp; Here a day
stands for a thousand years, &ldquo;for a day with the Lord is as
a thousand years;&rdquo; so that when two thousand years should
have passed by, Ephraim, who stands for Israel, was to be revived
and blessed with fruitfulness sometime during the third day, or
thousand years.&nbsp; In ancient time a day was counted when it
had a majority&mdash;that is, when it had passed the half.&nbsp;
The prophet here says we were to be revived, or raised up, on the
third day.&nbsp; So, if you again take these three thousand-year
days, you will find that two of them are to be completely passed,
and during the third we were to be raised.&nbsp; The number we
have given, 2,520, exactly meets the interpretation&mdash;2,000
complete, and 520 make a majority for the third day by the twenty
over the half.&nbsp; These prophetic <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>figures tally
well with the existing state of things.&nbsp; About the beginning
of this century England assumed to lead the world.&nbsp; It is a
remarkable coincidence that, in the last century, the question of
how to multiply the population was a subject of debate and
legislation in the British Parliament.&nbsp; But what legislation
failed to do, God in His providence did at the appointed
time.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact, and well worth noticing, that the famous
witness of the Lord of hosts in Egypt, the Great Pyramid,
forecasts what the number of Israel and Judah would be in the
year 1882.&nbsp; As Israel is symbolised in the Grand Gallery, it
is found that the cubic contents of the same, in inches, is about
36,000,000; thus by some this is interpreted to mean that inches
stand for individuals, and if so, then England proper will have
this number in 1880.&nbsp; Whether this is a true interpretation
or not, we all know that these figures will be about right.&nbsp;
The Queen&rsquo;s Chamber of the Pyramid symbolises the number
and condition of the Jews.</p>
<p>From these two prophecies, so sublimely fulfilling, let me
invite your attention to another that is now maturing.&nbsp; It,
too, is parallel with the other two.&nbsp; We refer to the
peculiar growth, power, and progress of the English
language.&nbsp; After Israel went into captivity, they were to
lose their language and take or form another.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
with stammering lips and another tongue will He speak to this
people&rdquo; (Isa. xxviii. 11).&nbsp; We will all agree that the
English language is not the Hebrew; and if we are Israelites,
then indeed God is speaking to us in another tongue, for few of
us read His Word in Hebrew.&nbsp; It is read to the millions in
the English; hence the millions hear God speak to them in another
tongue than that of Hebrew.&nbsp; Between the English and Hebrew
languages there is an intimate relation, especially back a few
years, before the English had grown so much.&nbsp; The Hebrew was
a very limited language; not numbering more than 7,000
words.&nbsp; The English is now said <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>to number
about 80,000.&nbsp; The most lavish writer does not use over
10,000; the common average is about 3,000.&nbsp; In the English
we have not less than 1,000 Hebrew roots.&nbsp; This, comparing
the languages a few years back, is a large percentage.&nbsp; In
names of persons and places the Hebrew is very prominent in
England.</p>
<p>I take it for a fact that language is of Divine origin.&nbsp;
Men have written on the origin of language from every standpoint;
the majority of them trying to account for its existence without
allowing so noble a source.&nbsp; The first man, Adam, I believe,
could talk as easily and naturally as he could see, and hear, and
taste.&nbsp; Speech was a part of his endowment.&nbsp; There is
nothing more wonderful in a man talking than a bird singing, save
that speech is a higher order of utterance.&nbsp; Dumb nature
performs marvels every day as mighty and wonderful as man&rsquo;s
talking.&nbsp; The honey-bee builds its cells, ignorant of the
fact that such construction is the solution of a problem which
had troubled men for centuries to solve.&nbsp; At what point
shall certain lines meet so as to give the most room with the
least material and have the greatest strength in the
building?&nbsp; This problem is said to have been worked out by a
Mr. McLaughland, a noted Scotch mathematician, who arrived at his
conclusion by laborious and careful fluxionary calculation.&nbsp;
To his surprise, and to the surprise of the world, such lines and
such a building were found in the common bee cell.&nbsp; Now I
hold that the same Creator who gave to the bee the mathematical
instinct could endow man with the instinct of speech.&nbsp; Even
to animal instinct we find a certain variation and permitted
latitude in what is called adaptive instinct.&nbsp; So in man we
find this same instinct of adaptation in a higher sense.&nbsp;
The instinct comes into play when we suppose a number of persons
separated from others, each living in different quarters of the
globe.&nbsp; In such a condition, though of the same language
when first separated, they would not remain so long&mdash;that
is, in the <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>primitive state of society.&nbsp;
Thus, among the tribes of Africa, at this day, languages are
widening and varying from a once common centre.&nbsp; So Israel
in captivity would lose the Hebrew gradually.&nbsp; The language
of the people among whom they settled was the Sanskrit, from
which a score of languages have come&mdash;the German, French,
and Italian, Saxon and others.&nbsp; The Saxon of to-day,
compared with the Saxon of 2,000 years ago, is very different; so
much so that for us to learn and speak it would be equal to
learning a new language.&nbsp; Thus the English language is a
thing of growth.&nbsp; In the year 1362 the Saxon was made the
court language of England.&nbsp; From that time onward its growth
has been wonderful.</p>
<p>The prophetic outlines and Divine place of this language may
be seen in the germal foundations, which give unto it such
vigour, tenacity, and capabilities of expansion.&nbsp; All the
features of this language go to show that it is destined to be
the medium of a world&rsquo;s intercourse, and that it very
suitably belongs to Israel, in whose hand will be the destiny of
the world.&nbsp; It is the lion of languages.&nbsp; It will grow
anywhere, and by reason of its tenacity when once it gets a
foothold it abides.&nbsp; It is peculiarly suited to the
humanities of every race, clime, and condition; there is no limit
to its expansive adaptability.&nbsp; It is in a special manner
voracious in the destruction of other languages; wherever it
goes, it sounds the death-knell of all the rest.</p>
<p>Soon as this language entered Britain, it began its work of
destruction.&nbsp; Before it has disappeared the real British,
the Cymric or Welsh, Erse or Irish, the Gaelic of Scotland, and
the Manx of the Isle of Man.&nbsp; The British Keltic is entirely
gone; the rest are entirely local.&nbsp; Beside these it ousted
from the island the Norse, the Norman-French, and several other
tongues that tried to transplant themselves on English
soil.&nbsp; It is at work in every part of the globe, planting
itself and displacing others.&nbsp; A few years ago French was
the language best suited <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>for a
traveller on the Continent.&nbsp; But this has changed.&nbsp; Now
the English is by far superior.&nbsp; And why is it that the
English is supplanting all others?&nbsp; To answer such a
question in a scientific way, one cannot do better than quote
from the great and learned German philologist, Prof. Grimm, of
Berlin.&nbsp; He says of it: &ldquo;It has a thorough power of
expression, such as no other language ever possessed.&nbsp; It
may truly be called a world-language, for no other can compare
with it in richness, reasonableness, and solidity of
texture.&rdquo;&nbsp; But perhaps the most definite and distinct
testimony given by a foreigner touching the future ubiquity of
the Anglo-Saxon race and language, is that put forward by Provost
Paradol, a learned Frenchman.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;that neither
Russia nor united Germany, supposing that they should attain the
highest fortune, can pretend to impede that current of things,
nor prevent that solution, relatively near at hand, of the long
rivalry of European races for the ultimate colonisation and
domination of the universe.&nbsp; The world will not be Russian,
nor German, nor French, alas! nor Spanish.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
concludes that it will be Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>A British poet has presented in poetry the special features of
several of the European languages, which we give:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Greek&rsquo;s a harp we love to hear;<br />
Latin is a trumpet clear;<br />
Spanish like an organ swells;<br />
Italian rings its bridal bells;<br />
France, with many a frolic mien,<br />
Tunes her sprightly violin;<br />
Loud the German rolls his drum<br />
When Russia&rsquo;s clashing cymbals come;<br />
But British sons may well rejoice,<br />
For English is the human voice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are eight languages in the bounds of Christian
civilisation that may be accounted powerful, because they are the
tongues of vigorous people; they are the English, Russian, <!--
page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and
Scandinavian.&nbsp; But of these all are indigenous, except the
English, so that they die if transplanted.&nbsp; Look at this
country and behold what a cemetery it is for languages.&nbsp;
Once the French had strong hold and promised to abide here; but
it is now nearly gone, even from the state of Louisiana and
Canada, the last places of retreat.</p>
<p>If we take note of the population according to these several
languages, we shall see the prophetic future of the
English.&nbsp; It is spoken by about ninety millions, Russian
seventy-five, German fifty-six, French forty, Spanish
thirty-eight, Italian twenty-nine, Portuguese fourteen, and
Scandinavian nine.&nbsp; Within the control of the governments of
these languages we find England to have rule over 255,000,000
people, who do not as yet speak English, and we find that the
other seven have only seventy-five millions outside of
themselves.&nbsp; Here is an important difference.&nbsp; If we
look at them by territorial limits, leaving out Russia, we find
the English language to own 13,382,686 square miles, Germany
449,684, French 571,578, Spanish 4,694,811, Italian 114,466,
Portuguese 4,028,311, and Scandinavian 1,308,830.&nbsp; The
aggregate number of square miles possessed by these six
languages, is 11,167,620, which altogether, you see, own
2,215,066 miles square less than the English.&nbsp; The balance
itself is more than Germany, France, and Spain put
together.&nbsp; The English language is divided only into two
governments, but the other six are divided into twenty-six, all
of which governments are bitter one toward the other; each trying
to supplant one another, while England and the United States are
at peace, and will ever remain so.&nbsp; In one hundred years
from now the English language will be spoken by a thousand
million people.&nbsp; Thus we need no stretch of fancy to see
that what the prophet speaks of in the text will be accomplished
in due time.</p>
<p>This language will soon be universal; by common consent it
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>will become the language of the world.&nbsp; All the
changes going on among nations forecast its ubiquity.&nbsp;
China, by an imperial decree, has just added to her language 700
English words.&nbsp; Her sons by the thousand are with us, and by
the thousand they are learning our mother tongue.&nbsp; The
Japanese, till a few years ago, carried on their foreign
correspondence through the Dutch, but now they have changed to
the English.&nbsp; Besides, in the 50,000 schools in Japan
English is being taught.&nbsp; If science has an answer for this
strange phenomenon, so have we.&nbsp; Ours is, that it is the
will of Heaven.&nbsp; Confusion of tongues came at Babel as a
punishment.&nbsp; By this means Heaven scattered the unwilling
descendants of Noah.&nbsp; When Noah came forth from the Ark, God
bade him multiply and replenish the earth&mdash;that is, fill it
up.&nbsp; Babel, however, was built as a monument of
centralisation, for the builders gave as a reason for building
it, &ldquo;Lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; By a confusion of tongues they were
scattered.&nbsp; Since then we have had some 1,500 distinct
languages, and some 3,500 colloquials, or say 5,000 different
forms of speech.&nbsp; At the present time 600 of the primary are
dead, so that there are about 900 languages now spoken on all the
earth, with about 2,500 colloquials.</p>
<p>When these means have answered their end&mdash;namely, to make
us occupy all parts of the earth&mdash;then they will die
out.&nbsp; It then follows that as the world fills, languages
must disappear.&nbsp; So they do.&nbsp; The English and German
were the last languages to come into existence.&nbsp; No new ones
are now being made.&nbsp; Alphabets are increasing, because
missionaries are reducing spoken languages among the heathen into
a written form.&nbsp; The Bible is translated into two hundred
different tongues.&nbsp; This itself will only lead the millions
back to English.&nbsp; All ship papers are now made out in
English excepting the French, and no doubt they will soon have to
follow in the wake.</p>
<p>The day of Pentecost foreshowed the universality of some <!--
page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>language.&nbsp; Pentecost was a type, and the English is
the antitype.&nbsp; The strangers from Phrygia, Pamphylia, Libya,
Pontus, and Cappadocia, mingled with the Parthians, Medes,
Elamites, Cretes, and Arabians.&nbsp; They all heard the Gospel
in their own tongue.&nbsp; The different tongues make a wall of
division, making them strangers one with another; but the Holy
Ghost took away this wall, and they were all face to face, able
to understand one another.&nbsp; The same power that here
multiplied the gift of tongues&mdash;giving to some
several&mdash;surely could give to Adam one.&nbsp; Away with a
faith that cannot give God credit with being the Author of
language.</p>
<p>No sooner do we see England in guardian possession of Syria
than the idea enters into the scheme of reform of extending the
English language.&nbsp; The Board of Directors of the Syrian
Protestant College at Beyrout have shown their appreciation of
the new era of British influence by a recent vote, which is to
the effect that on January 1, 1879, all instruction in the
college shall be through the English language.&nbsp; The Arabic
will only be taught as any other dead language.&nbsp; This
remarkable action shows that British influence in Syria is
hereafter to be more than simply diplomatic; it is to be an
all-pervading and controlling power, affecting every interest of
Society.&nbsp; Truly another Pentecostal day is drawing
nigh&mdash;a day when all the world shall hear the Gospel in the
language of Israel.&nbsp; In all these things we see the lively
tokens and pre-millennial agencies hastening on the day of the
Lord.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now, if the fall of them be the riches of
the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the
Gentiles, how much more their fulness.&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. ii.
12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul, the author of this epistle to the Romans, tells us that
he was an Israelite of the seed of Abraham and of the Tribe of
Benjamin.&nbsp; The fact so conveyed it is necessary that we keep
in mind, if we would interpret aright this epistle.&nbsp; He
introduces to our notice three parties: the Jews, who include at
this time the Tribes of Judah and Levi; the Israelites, who
embraced the Tribe of Benjamin and the other nine Tribes that had
been in captivity for about eight hundred years&mdash;the whole
together are generally known as the Ten Lost Tribes.&nbsp; In the
third party we have the Gentiles.&nbsp; This word Gentile usually
denotes and includes the non-Jewish nations and people.&nbsp; The
Hebrew word <i>goyim</i>, in early Bible history, was equivalent
to our word nation.&nbsp; It finally began to denote any people
who were not of the sacred seed of Abraham.&nbsp; The Greek word
so rendered is <i>ethnos</i>, which means a multitude or
nation.&nbsp; In the New Testament another word is sometimes used
in a more limited sense&mdash;namely, <i>hellenes</i>, which is
translated Greeks.&nbsp; Ignorance of these three parties, their
place in Providence, and relation one to the other, has given
rise to much needless controversy and division in the domain of
theology.&nbsp; Men have argued for an election and a
reprobation, laying great stress on <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the 9th,
10th, and 11th chapters of Romans, that is in no wise
taught.&nbsp; The election Paul deals with is a literal one,
having reference to a distinct people, whom God has elected for a
special work in this world.&nbsp; This people God calls
&ldquo;His people,&rdquo; &ldquo;His inheritance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;His chosen,&rdquo; &ldquo;His witnesses,&rdquo; &ldquo;His
servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This people have I formed for
Myself; they shall shew forth My praise&rdquo; (Isa. xliii.
21).&nbsp; Hence exclaims the Psalmist, &ldquo;Blessed is the
nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom He hath chosen
for His own inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be evident to any careful Bible reader that God called
Abraham from Ur, in Chaldea, from his own kindred, for a special
design.&nbsp; Through Abraham&rsquo;s seed Jehovah designed that
blessings, temporal and spiritual, should flow to all
nations.&nbsp; He selected this seed for His own training,
instruction, and culture, to the end that they might train,
instruct, and evangelise the rest of mankind.&nbsp; Through Judah
was to come spiritual blessings, because from Him was the
Messiah; and through Ephraim, as representative of the Ten
Tribes, was to come temporal blessings.&nbsp; And this in the
past has been the order of providential procedure; it is the
present order, and it is to be the future.&nbsp; Look and verify
this statement and order by an examination of the nations of the
earth at this time, by asking yourselves the question: What form
of religion among the many on earth is best suited to develop
man, to conserve his truest interest, and crown him with the
greatest measure of peace, plenty, liberty, and security?&nbsp;
Surely to this question there can be but one answer&mdash;it is
the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; And it is evident
that Christ came of the Tribe of Judah.&nbsp; If we seek among
the nations for the best form of civilisation and the best
government, we shall find the same to be in the bounds of Israel
and Manasseh&mdash;England and America.&nbsp; Here we shall find
individualism the best developed, and liberty the fullest
grown.&nbsp; In this conclusion the intelligent of every other
nation will concur.&nbsp; We assume no <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>risk in
making this statement.&nbsp; Thus, without doubt, the world at
large is greatly indebted to the religion of Jesus, who was of
Judah, and to the Anglo-Saxons, for the best and purest forms of
political organisations or governments.&nbsp; The Anglo-Saxons
being the Ten Lost Tribes, it therefore follows that God has
carried out the design included in Abraham&rsquo;s call, and the
promise made that in his seed should all the nations of the earth
be blessed.&nbsp; To us it seems to have been a roundabout
way.&nbsp; Had Israel been obedient to God in Palestine, and had
Judah received Jesus as the true Messiah, the state of the
nations most certainly would have been very different to what it
is now.&nbsp; Still, through all, and for all, the purpose of
heaven has been carried forward.</p>
<p>In studying Providence it is always well to remember that God
is not dependent on the harmonious co-operation of His creatures
for the accomplishment of His purpose.&nbsp; He can gain His ends
either through our hate or love, resistance or
co-operation.&nbsp; When the Jews had crucified Christ, they
naturally thought they had cut short His career and cut off His
influence; for so it would appear by all human reasoning.&nbsp;
Even the disciples did not see how He could be the Messiah and
Deliverer of Israel when He allowed Himself to be
crucified.&nbsp; The hope of Israel was buried with the dead
Christ.&nbsp; They had hoped that it had been He who should have
redeemed Israel; but this hope was then dead.&nbsp; But by His
resurrection they saw through the secret of Providence, and they
saw that God was faithful in devising a way of escape, and able
to bring to pass His own glorious purpose.&nbsp; So Peter voices
their experience when he says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which, according to His abundant
mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jews
soon found out they had made a mistake in crucifying Jesus; for
the risen Christ was mightier than the teaching Jesus.&nbsp; They
had crushed a seed to the earth which sprang forth in renewed
beauty and grace; whose death <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>was life and
whose loss was gain.&nbsp; In common parlance they had been
outwitted.&nbsp; They slew a man and He rose a God.&nbsp; They in
wrath offered a sacrifice once and for all, even for the very sin
in which they were then indulging.&nbsp; They unknowingly
abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light.&nbsp;
The critical and unbelieving Sadducees, who denied another life
than this, gave aid in proving another and a better; for Christ
risen condemned their unbelief.&nbsp; The proud and ritualistic
Pharisee, who loved the temple and its gorgeous ceremony,
destroyed one and made the other of none avail, for in the
planted death of Jesus they laid the foundation of another and
grander temple&mdash;one composed of living stones&mdash;and made
the temple service meaningless; for the anti-type had swallowed
up the type; the real, the ideal.&nbsp; In all this they had
reasoned on a human plan, which is not high enough to wholly
overlook and explore the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Paul, in 1 Cor.
ii. 7, makes this matter plain: &ldquo;But we speak the wisdom of
God in a mystery; even the hidden wisdom which God ordained
before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of
this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have
crucified the Lord of glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus committed His
life to the wave-tide of their rage, and was floated to death and
victory.&nbsp; On the man side there was purpose and hate, and
for this they were responsible; and on the Divine side we have
wisdom and love working out the salvation of a lost race.</p>
<p>Jesus came to His own and they did not receive Him.&nbsp; Who
were His own?&nbsp; We answer, the Jews; for He was of
Judah.&nbsp; But if His own did not receive Him, we ask, who
did?&nbsp; The answer is, that Israel received Him.&nbsp; The
Israelites in the land at that time were the Tribe of
Benjamin.&nbsp; They had been providentially selected for this
work nearly a thousand years before.&nbsp; This one Tribe of
Benjamin has a very peculiar history; and it you will study it
over, it will greatly serve to confirm your faith in the Divine
inspiration of the Bible and the unity <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and
forethought of Providence.&nbsp; The original theocracy of Israel
consisted of Twelve Tribes.&nbsp; This theocracy was divided
under Rehoboam, Solomon&rsquo;s son and successor.&nbsp; Ten
Tribes seceded, and formed a kingdom, which is ever after called
the kingdom of Israel; their first king was Jeroboam.&nbsp; But
it is very singular to notice, that one of these Ten Tribes is
lent to the kingdom of Judah, and this one Tribe is
Benjamin.&nbsp; In this was the Divine provision for the time of
Christ.&nbsp; We find in the first book of Kings, eleventh
chapter, that Solomon displeased the Lord by his wicked ways, and
the Lord said: &ldquo;Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou
hast not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded
thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and I will give
it to thy servant (Jeroboam was Solomon&rsquo;s servant at that
time); notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David
thy father&rsquo;s sake; but I will rend it out of the hands of
thy son.&nbsp; Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom, but
will give one Tribe to thy son, for David My servant&rsquo;s
sake, and for Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake, which I have
chosen.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the kingdom evidently meant the Ten
Tribes.&nbsp; The same truth Ahijah, the Shilonite, taught when
he rent his new garment into twelve pieces, and gave to Jeroboam
ten.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces;
for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend
the kingdom out of the hands of Solomon and will give Ten Tribes
to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then comes in the reserve clause again:
&ldquo;But he shall have one Tribe for My servant David&rsquo;s
sake, and for Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake, the city which I have
chosen out of all the Tribes of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
reason for the reservation of this Tribe is clearly expressed in
verse 36: &ldquo;And unto his son will I give one Tribe, that
David My servant may always have a light before Me in
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it is plain why this Tribe was an
exception.&nbsp; The city of Jerusalem, God says, He has chosen
out of all the cities of Israel, because to this city would the
Messiah come.&nbsp; And beautifully agreeing <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>with the
forethought is the fact that when the Tribes had their lots
assigned them in Palestine, the city of Jerusalem fell in the
portion of Benjamin.</p>
<p>The Tribe then were owners of the city, and they received
Christ.&nbsp; The disciples and first followers and converts were
chiefly from this Tribe of Benjamin.&nbsp; After this Tribe
received Christ, then their work was done in Jerusalem.&nbsp; So
they were to separate from the kingdom of Judah, and seek out
their own brethren and unite with them.&nbsp; The time of their
separation had been foretold by the prophet, and pointed out by
the Saviour.&nbsp; The time of their departure would be
coincident with the siege and destruction of their beloved
city.&nbsp; So cried Jeremiah down through the centuries,
&ldquo;Oh, ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out
of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set
up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem, for evil appeareth out of the
North and great destruction &ldquo;(Jer. vi. 1).&nbsp; If any of
you are mindful to examine history, you will find that war came,
that the destruction was terrible, and more, you will find that
the Benjaminites escaped.&nbsp; These points profane historians
thoroughly confirm.&nbsp; Having fulfilled their God-appointed
mission with the kingdom of Judah and in Jerusalem, Heaven gave
them to be light-bearers to the whole world; first to specially
find their own brethren of the House of Israel, and carry them
the Gospel, and they would carry it unto all the earth.&nbsp;
Thus the Saviour said, &ldquo;Go not in the way of the Gentiles,
and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.&nbsp; But go
rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Peter in his epistle tells where these lost sheep were
scattered.&nbsp; Agreeable to the Saviour&rsquo;s command they
went forth, and preached as they went, and so carried the Gospel
of Jesus with them.&nbsp; As a Tribe they finally settled in
Normandy, and gave to France her Protestantism, which, from that
day to this, Catholicism has not been able entirely to uproot,
though it has made several desperate attempts.&nbsp; They
finally, however, <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>as a Tribe, under the Norman
conquest, entered England and united with the other nine
Tribes.&nbsp; Their advent, and the way they came, is very
graphically symbolised in the unicorn on the royal arms of
England.&nbsp; The unicorn is looking Westward, and is attached
to the crown by a chain&mdash;showing that it came from the
East.</p>
<p>With these facts in one&rsquo;s mind, read those difficult
passages in Romans, and all will be plain.&nbsp; Take, for
instance, Romans xi. 17: &ldquo;And if some of the branches be
broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in
among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of
the olive tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here it is manifest that we have
three parties mentioned.&nbsp; The branches broken off mean Judah
and Levi, the wild olive stands for the Gentiles, the people in
among whom they were grafted, or root of whose fatness they were
partakers, mean the Israelites.&nbsp; The hope of Jewish
restoration is nicely set forth in verse 24: &ldquo;For if thou
wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert
grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more
shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their
own olive tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, the wild olive stands for the
Gentiles, the good olive tree for Israel, the branches broken
off, but which may be grafted in again, for the Jews.&nbsp; Thus
to this theory of interpretation the whole Bible responds easily
and reasonably.&nbsp; With this kind of interpretation one need
not twist and distort the sacred Word in order to understand
it.&nbsp; I trust the day is near when men will expound the
sacred Scriptures by the rules of common sense.</p>
<p>The calamity that happened to the nine Tribes of Israel in
been carried captive has been turned into good by our heavenly
Father&mdash;into good for them and all the world.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Therefore the Lord removed Israel out of His sight, as He
had said by all His servants the prophets.&nbsp; So was Israel
carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this
day&rdquo; (2 Kings xvii. 23).&nbsp; <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Keeping back
the Tribe of Benjamin is a marvel of goodness.&nbsp; And with
Paul we may exclaim: &ldquo;Now if the fall of them be the riches
of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the
Gentiles, how much more their fulness.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Israel had
been able to contribute so much of Christianity to the world, and
evolve in her imperfect state such an equitable form of
government, what will her contribution be when gathered,
restored, and once again put into a theocratic relation to
God?&nbsp; &ldquo;For if the casting away of them be the
reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be,
but life from the dead?&rdquo;&nbsp; This people who have been
scattered among the Gentiles God is collecting out from among
them for His own glorious purpose and work.&nbsp; Thus scattered
they have been a mystery&mdash;a mystery among the
Gentiles.&nbsp; Paul to the Colossians says: &ldquo;To whom God
would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery
among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you the hope of
glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When will the fulness of the text take place?&nbsp; We
answer.&nbsp; Before long.&nbsp; The fulness here stands over
against the Gentile fulness.&nbsp; In the three last discourses
we called your attention to Israel&rsquo;s maturing fulness in
land, people, and language.&nbsp; And now, if you will consider
the state of the Gentile nations, it will be apparent to you that
the time of Gentile fulness is now present.&nbsp; These Gentile
nations are now overflowing.&nbsp; Take China with her teeming
millions, and ask why she has not peopled the world? for surely
she could have done so long ago.&nbsp; But she barred her own
doors by making it unlawful for any of her subjects to leave the
flowery kingdom&mdash;forbidding heaven to such as should die
outside.&nbsp; Now, however, she must permit emigration or perish
by famine.&nbsp; Take the countries of Europe, and is it not
strange that Israel&rsquo;s fulness of land, people, and language
is made the fuller by these nations contributing towards the
same?&nbsp; The fulness of the Gentiles is made to flow into the
fulness of Israel.&nbsp; These countries, outside of
Israel-England, <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>have no colonies to send their
overflow to; hence, they are filling up the domain of Israel and
so hastening on her fulness.&nbsp; The French, Germans, Italians,
and Spaniards forsake their land and language, thus adding to
Israel&rsquo;s fulness; for they chiefly settle down within the
bounds of Israel.&nbsp; To this Gentile fulness there was to be
one strange exception&mdash;that was in the Turkish nation.&nbsp;
This nation is set forth by the prophet under the figure of the
River Euphrates.&nbsp; In their first appearance they were to be
very numerous.&nbsp; In the eleventh century they began to invade
Europe.&nbsp; The historian Gibbon, speaking of them, says:
&ldquo;Myriads of Turkish horsemen overspread the whole Greek
empire, until at last Constantinople fell into their
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; From 1453 till now have they held this grand
capital.&nbsp; John, in Rev. ix., pictures this invasion, and
speaks of the number of horsemen.&nbsp; He speaks of them as
having power in their mouths and tails.&nbsp; This language is
very expressive when we remember the Moslem&rsquo;s war-cry,
which was &ldquo;The sword of Mahomet and of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in one of the first of their great battles they lost their
standard; but, not long baffled, the commander-in-chief cut off
the tail of his beautiful steed, and, putting it on the end of a
pole, hoisted it as a standard.&nbsp; This ensign they long
used.&nbsp; This kingdom, however, is to dry up&mdash;that is, to
disappear gradually, as a river dries up.&nbsp; All this is
taking place.&nbsp; Turkey sends emigrants nowhere.&nbsp; They
are literally dying out.&nbsp; In number they are fewer each
year.&nbsp; Turkey will pass away for want of Turks.&nbsp; Her
territory will be taken away from her gradually.&nbsp; How
remarkable the dealings of Providence with men and nations!</p>
<p>Up to the point of Gentile fulness, Israel was to be partly
blind, for God&rsquo;s plans, through Israel, were to remain a
mystery for a time.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I would not, brethren, that
ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in
your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel,
until <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the fulness of the Gentiles be come
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our idea is that the Gentile fulness is now in,
and if so, it is natural, then, that Israel should be found, and
about this time have her eyes opened.&nbsp; Up to this time of
fulness, Jerusalem was to be trodden down.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they
shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into
all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles,
until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled&rdquo; (Luke xxi.
23).&nbsp; Now, the Jews did fall by the edge of the sword, as
the Saviour foretold; they were carried captive into all nations;
Jerusalem has been trodden under foot.&nbsp; Thus, then, do we
see three parts of His prophecy literally fulfilled; and so
surely will the fourth part be, which is, that in connection with
Gentile fulness this treading shall cease, and proud, imperial
Salem shall lift her head once more free from tyrant hands and
heathen tramping, to become the city of God and His chosen
ones.</p>
<p>When Moses was sent to deliver the children of Israel from
Egypt, he was equipped with miraculous power that he might
convince Pharaoh and the Egyptians what was the will of Jehovah;
but not more so than are the prophetic students of this day; for
the presence of the Divine gleams forth all around in the
miracles of prophecy now so wonderfully fulfilling in this our
day.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou, O King, sawest and beheld a great
image.&nbsp; This great image whose brightness was excellent,
stood before thee; and the form thereof was
terrible.&rdquo;&mdash;Dan. ii. 31.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About 2,500 years ago the kingdom of Babylon was strong,
great, and prosperous.&nbsp; The king of this vast empire is
known in history as Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; His reign had been
marked with great victories over the surrounding nations.&nbsp;
The mighty Empire of Assyria he had conquered; Egypt he had
wasted and almost destroyed; Palestine he had reduced to strange
and pitiable desolation, having carried the Jewish inhabitants
captive into the region of Babylon.&nbsp; Among these captives we
find Daniel, the prophet of Judah.&nbsp; In the second year of
Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s consolidated reign, as king over Babylon
and Assyria, he dreamed a dream which gave him much anxiety of
mind and troubled him very much.&nbsp; This dream he could not
remember nor explain, save that it had left a terrible impression
on his mind.&nbsp; The wise men were confounded, for they could
neither declare the vision or its meaning.&nbsp; The king, in his
rage, decreed them all to death.&nbsp; At this point appears
Daniel, one of the captives of Judah.&nbsp; Moved of God, he
presents himself before the king and makes known to him the
vision and interpretation.</p>
<p>The king had seen a great metallic image, excellent in
brightness and terrible in form.&nbsp; It was a human figure of
massive proportions, standing erect with outstretched arms, <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>and of a mixed and strange composition.&nbsp; The head
was of fine gold.&nbsp; The breast and arms were of silver.&nbsp;
The belly and thighs of brass.&nbsp; The legs of iron, the feet
part of iron and part of clay.&nbsp; While the king was gazing on
this monstrous figure with intense interest, his attention was
arrested by the appearance of a small stone&mdash;this stone was
alone; there appeared no hands handling it or moving it.&nbsp; It
was cut out of the mountain without hands.&nbsp; In this stone
there appears to be a good deal of the supernatural.&nbsp; At
once this little stone assaults the image, beginning at the
feet.&nbsp; The battle is surely unequal; the battle continues,
and during the struggle the stone actually grows; the image falls
to pieces&mdash;the feet, thigh, breast, and head&mdash;and
victory is with the stone.&nbsp; By the time the image is wholly
destroyed the stone has become a mountain; or, as Daniel said to
Nebuchadnezzar, &ldquo;Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out
without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of
iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.&nbsp; Then was the iron,
the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces
together, and became like the chaff of the Summer
threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place
was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a
great mountain and filled the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this vision and interpretation we have a line of history
laid bare so clearly that we need not err.&nbsp; The beginning is
the time and kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; The image stands
for four great earthly monarchies, extending down through the
centuries even to this time and day&mdash;and a little further;
for these monarchies are not yet wholly destroyed, and the
stone-kingdom does not yet fill the world.&nbsp; Of this fifth,
or stone kingdom, there is to be no end by conquest, or decay, or
succession.&nbsp; Daniel says that this kingdom shall not be left
to other people&mdash;that is, it shall never be succeeded.</p>
<p>The peculiar features of the stone-kingdom make it interesting
to ascertain what kingdom, monarchy, and people stand for <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>it; for such kingdom, though small at the beginning, is
to grow, prosper, and continue to the end of time.&nbsp; Guided
by the Scriptures and history, let us look for these four earthly
monarchies; and the better to accomplish our task, let us stretch
the giant figure on his back; then his head of gold will rest in
Babylon, his silver breast and arms will take in Media and
Persia, his belly and thighs will take in Greece, and his legs
and feet will take in Rome.&nbsp; Thus, then, the gold head stood
for Babylon, and is now in this day represented and found in
Russia&mdash;for Russia is a continuation of Babylon.&nbsp; The
<i>Czar</i> is on the line of Nebuchadne<i>zzar</i>.&nbsp; This
gold-headed kingdom will be the last destroyed&mdash;the
destruction begins at the feet.&nbsp; Russia, therefore, has yet
a lease of life and prosperity; but, finally, she too will yield
the contests and disappear before the stone-kingdom.&nbsp; The
gold stands for work and endurance, as the head is significant of
supremacy; but the stone will finally destroy it.</p>
<p>The silver, next in value and endurance, of which were the
arms and breast, stands for Persia.&nbsp; Centuries ago Persia
was the great Power of the earth.&nbsp; At one time it would seem
as if she never would decay or ever have a rival; but her day
came, and she has dwindled down to the little kingdom and
monarchy&mdash;the Persia of to-day.&nbsp; Her power is gone, she
is consumptive, and will soon disappear as a separate
kingdom.&nbsp; The present visit of the King of Persia to the
Czar at St. Petersburg is not without meaning.&nbsp; The gold
head of Russia will need the assistance of the arms of Persia
by-and-bye.</p>
<p>The brass parts stand well and appropriately for ancient
Greece&mdash;an Empire once so gigantic and powerful, a people so
polished and learned, but long ago their time, and work, and
place were marked out.&nbsp; And now the time is nearly gone and
the work done, hence they will soon disappear.&nbsp; The present
little kingdom of Greece is all that is left.&nbsp; Brass is in
itself corrosive, so the Greek Empire has gradually eaten itself
away.&nbsp; What sublime lessons the prophets of old taught
us!</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>The iron and clay, of which were the legs and feet,
stand for the great Roman Empire, which in its day was so solid
and grand with its law and order, its soldiers and
statesmen.&nbsp; This Empire that tried the hopeless experiment
of mixing clay and iron&mdash;that is, Church and State as
inaugurated by Constantine.&nbsp; This nation that tried to fuse
together Paganism and Christianity.&nbsp; This nation that tried
to stand on two equal feet, and to encompass the whole of man,
body and spirit.&nbsp; Well might Daniel say of this brittle
Empire that it should be partly strong and partly weak.&nbsp; In
conscience and the empire of the soul Christ alone is King.&nbsp;
No wonder that the Roman Empire has disappeared.&nbsp; The iron
part is now entirely gone.&nbsp; The Pope and the Church of Rome
foolishly arrogate to themselves to be this kingdom.&nbsp; They
still try and believe in mixing the iron and clay&mdash;they yet
claim authority in the spirit realm.&nbsp; Obedience to Christ
and the Pope cannot be on the spiritual or clay side.&nbsp; No
man can supremely serve two masters.&nbsp; On the iron side no
man can be loyal to his country and the Pope at the same
time.&nbsp; No man can serve two masters at the same time, both
of which claim and demand supremacy.&nbsp; These things cannot be
mixed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry
clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they
shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with
clay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How true the prophetic utterances of the prophet!&nbsp; The
Catholics and Protestants do not mix easily, not socially, not
politically, nor educationally.&nbsp; How are we to mix freely
with those who think we are heretics and damnable?&nbsp; How can
we socially mix with a people so lordly in their claims and
deficient in character as many are&mdash;a people who, when true
to their profession, must be our secret or open enemies&mdash;who
sink their manhood and parental claims, so as to depend upon the
priest for forgiveness and on him for instruction?&nbsp; Thus, at
the priest&rsquo;s command, the coming generations are divided
and <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>embittered in the fact of separate schools for Catholics
and Protestants.&nbsp; These men of clay and lordly air, claim
rights superior to the State, despising the State provision for
education.&nbsp; Daniel said, &ldquo;The dream is certain, and
the interpretation thereof sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; If so, as sure as
the iron part has disappeared, so will the clay.</p>
<p>Now a clearer view, a purer faith and greater liberty are
dawning upon our Catholic friends, which is making many of them
feel too manly and noble to be longer slaves to priest or
Pope.&nbsp; Bereft of temporal power, they henceforth will have
to win and fight their way, as others, on the purity of their
doctrines and practice.&nbsp; In such a strife we can but wish
them, and all who love the Lord Jesus Christ, great success.</p>
<p>Thus in the short outline of these four kingdoms we see enough
to show us that God has kept His word.&nbsp; How marvellous are
His ways! how complete His work!</p>
<p>Let us now look at this stone kingdom.&nbsp; This fifth
kingdom is as much material and political as the other four, and
stands for a king, country, and people.&nbsp; It does not come
into existence until the image is perfect.&nbsp; For it is while
Nebuchadnezzar was looking at the image he saw the stone cut out
of the mountain&mdash;its growth was gradual.&nbsp; Its work was
to destroy this image and fill the world.&nbsp; As these kingdoms
became weaker and smaller, it would become stronger and
larger.</p>
<p>What king, country, and people respond to this kingdom?&nbsp;
The answer is as easy as to find the other, if we keep our minds
free from prejudice and open to truth.</p>
<p>First, this kingdom was of Divine origin.&nbsp; Second, it was
small at first.&nbsp; Third, the more it fights the more it
grows.&nbsp; Fourth, it breaks in pieces this image, beginning at
the feet.&nbsp; It is in fact the sworn enemy of all the four
kingdoms.&nbsp; Fifth, it is to fill the world and thus become a
universal kingdom and monarchy.&nbsp; In this latter sense it
will be a fit type of the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Just such a kingdom as this did God repeatedly promise
to Abraham and his descendants.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s throne and
seed royal are to be established before Him for ever.&nbsp; He
promised to David&rsquo;s throne perpetuity, and that
David&rsquo;s seed should always be on the throne&mdash;not in a
spiritual sense as some think&mdash;but naturally and actually in
this world.</p>
<p>God promised to Israel, as a people and a kingdom, such
pre-eminence in origin, power, and growth.&nbsp; The answer,
then, is simple and plain&mdash;England, as representing the Lost
Tribes of Israel, and Queen Victoria being a direct descendant
from David.&nbsp; For she came of James VI., of Scotland&mdash;he
from Bruce and Duncan, and Malcolm, and Kenneth, and Kenneth
through the kings of Argyleshire, Alpin, and Donald, and
Fergus.&nbsp; Then through the long line of Irish Kings from
Earca to Heremon, of Tara, and he married Tea Tephi, the daughter
of Zedekiah, who, through Jeremiah the prophet, had been hid from
the destroying vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; He killed all
her brothers and kindred, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and
took him a captive to Babylon, where he died.</p>
<p>Look also at the British nation, learned as they are, yet no
historian can tell who the English were originally.&nbsp; Sharon
Turner, the best and most trustworthy on the origin of the
Saxons, fails to solve the question.&nbsp; He traces them into
Central Asia, but there he stops.&nbsp; They here form part of
the Aryan race, speaking the Sanscrit language, from which came
the Greek and Latin.&nbsp; And from this place and people came
forth the Goths and their language, and also the Saxons and their
language came to view here.&nbsp; The German and Saxon both seem
to have come forth from the Aryan stock.</p>
<p>The very place the Saxons came from is the very place where
the Lost Tribes were carried captive to by the King of Assyria,
about 725 years before Christ, as we read in the second book of
Kings, seventeenth chapter.&nbsp; Take the very word Saxon.&nbsp;
This word comes from the Sanscrit: Saka Suna.&nbsp; Saka means
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>era, epoch, or date, and Suna means void, without.&nbsp;
Hence the word Saxon means a people whose origin is
unknown&mdash;void of date.&nbsp; True, Nebuchadnezzar saw no
hands cutting the little stone out from the mountain.&nbsp; The
origin of the English nation is hid because God cast away His
people for a time&mdash;not for ever.&nbsp; It is this view of
the stone kingdom that corresponds to the prophets, to history,
especially to the English history.</p>
<p>The very island itself is insignificant, and no doubt was once
joined to the continent of Europe.&nbsp; The formation on both
sides of the English Channel&mdash;that is, on the French and
English coasts, are the same&mdash;namely, chalk.&nbsp; The ocean
in time past washed through a passage, and thus prepared a place
for exiled Israel to rest in, and renew their strength.</p>
<p>Why should this small island and a few and scattered people
become so powerful, so as to sweep the sea, and dictate on land,
constantly engaged in war, and though small, winning victory upon
victory, and like the stone, growing stronger and stronger, after
fighting the whole of Europe, giving liberties in religion that
oftentimes imperilled her safety at home, opening her ports to
all the world, and venturing to compete in trade with all
nations?</p>
<p>How came they to take India, a country of so vast an extent,
so powerful, rich, and chivalrous a country, at that time
composed of sixteen separate and powerful nations, speaking
thirty-six different languages, and numbering in population some
200,000,000?</p>
<p>With all her faults, still to her the world owes much.&nbsp;
She has stood for liberty in person and conscience.&nbsp; The
world has little to-day which ennobles men and nations but what
she has produced or aided in producing.</p>
<p>The right foot of the image stands for France, while the left
signifies Spain.&nbsp; On these two feet long stood Rome, as all
know.&nbsp; When these two feet were broken, then soon followed
<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>the downfall of Rome as an empire, and as they are
conquered for Jesus, so will the empire of Rome, as a Church,
fall.</p>
<p>In the year 1346 took place the battle of Cressey, led by
Edward III.&nbsp; Then the little stone fell on the right foot,
and since then it has fallen on that same foot victoriously 218
times.&nbsp; On the left foot, Spain, thirty-five times.&nbsp;
All this time this stone has been growing.&nbsp; In 1665 the
English, under General Penn, took Jamaica, and every four years
since they have added a colony.&nbsp; Now that little stone bears
rule over fifty-five colonies, one empire, namely, India, and one
dominion, Canada.&nbsp; And yet, mighty as England was, she could
not subdue the American provinces, feeble and scattered colonists
as they were.&nbsp; Then they sought to fight against
Providence.&nbsp; Old Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, Ephraim,
and Manasseh, and then predicted their destiny, saying of
Manasseh, &ldquo;He also shall become a people, and he also shall
be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he,
and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
they are; and so Manasseh is a great people in the American
nation.</p>
<p>This stone cut out of the mountain has much to do and destroy;
it is still watching the head of gold.&nbsp; Israel and Babylon
are still face to face.&nbsp; Greece will first disappear,
although England is trying to revive it.&nbsp; Next, Persia will
go, then Babylon, or head of gold.&nbsp; Russia will have grown
to giant-like proportions, and will finally measure swords with
England.&nbsp; The stone will win.&nbsp; England will then move
her royal residence and throne to Jerusalem.&nbsp; Every country
and province may then be independent, like Canada, but federated
to the central government.&nbsp; Ireland will then be free, yes,
doubly free&mdash;free from Rome and free from England as a
State, but still federated to the central government.&nbsp; It is
thus this stone will fill the earth.&nbsp; America will federate,
the central government will be destroyed.&nbsp; State rights
increase.&nbsp; These are some of the things suggested and taught
by this vision.</p>

84</span>LITTLE HORN AND TURKEY.<br />
<span class="smcap">Discourse</span> VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE TURKS THE ISHMAELITES&mdash;ENGLAND AND
RUSSIA TO PARTITION THE MAHOMMEDAN EMPIRE&mdash;WHY ENGLAND
SYMPATHISES WITH TURKEY.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And out of one of them came forth a little
horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the South, and toward
the East, and toward the pleasant land.&rdquo;&mdash;Daniel viii.
9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, in which he saw a great metallic
image of human form.&nbsp; The head of gold stood for Babylon;
the silver arms and breast for Persia; the brass belly and thighs
for Greece; the iron legs and feet of iron and clay for
Rome.&nbsp; To all this we find history has faithfully and
beautifully responded.</p>
<p>A few years after this we find that Daniel has a dream, which
is interpreted to him by an angel.&nbsp; From it we learn that
the ten toes symbolised ten kingdoms which were to arise out of
the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>In the chapter from which we take our text, we are introduced
into the secrets of a vision which Daniel had.&nbsp; The place of
the vision is on the banks of the River Ulai, in the province of
Elam, and in the gorgeous palace of Shushan&mdash;a place and
palace made famous and familiar to us by the doings of King
Ahasuerus and Queen Esther.&nbsp; In other words, the scene is
changed from the palace of Babylon to the palace of Persia.</p>
<p>In this vision, Pesia is typified by a ram, the two horns of
which represented Persia and Media, for they formed one Empire at
this time, under the powerful rule and reign of Cyrus, who,
coming from the East, pushed his conquests &ldquo;Westward, and
Northward, and Southward.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The two <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>horns
were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came
up last.&rdquo;&nbsp; From history we know that Media conquered
Persia, and we know, also, that finally Persia gained ascendancy,
so that the higher came up last, and is even in existence to-day
as the small kingdom of Persia; but Media has long since
disappeared.</p>
<p>While the seer Daniel was considering, behold an he-goat came
from the West.&nbsp; This goat had a notable horn between his
eyes.&nbsp; Horn generally symbolises power; here it symbolises a
king of peculiar power, Daniel tells us.&nbsp; Goat-like, it
bounded over the earth rapidly, pushing and goring its
adversaries.&nbsp; Can any one at all acquainted with history
fail to see how fitly and grandly this description of the goat
forecasts the origin and progress of the Greek Empire?</p>
<p>Substitute Alexander the Great for the notable horn, and you
at once mate history and this vision.&nbsp; Surely God has not
left Himself without witnesses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then the magicians
said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we
may freely say unto the historians and students of history,
Truly, in these things we see the finger of God.</p>
<p>Could any historian describe more faithfully and accurately
the invasions, conquests, and victories of Alexander the Great,
especially his assault on the Persians?&nbsp; How marvellous and
simple the description by Daniel: &ldquo;And he came to the ram
that had two horns (Persia), which I had seen standing before the
river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power; and I saw him
come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against
him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no
power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the
ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could
deliver the ram out of his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with the same majestic simplicity we have the downfall of
Alexander and the division of his Empire described.&nbsp;
Listen!&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore the he-goat waxed very great; and
when he was <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>strong the great horn was broken; and
for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To fully understand the sacred writer here, you must call to
mind a little of history, more and better, for all knowledge only
aids us the better and better to read the Bible.</p>
<p>What beast save the goat could characterise Alexander and his
reign?&nbsp; He was the son of Philip of Macedon, born 356 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and died in 323.&nbsp; He began his
reign at twenty years of age, and closed it in twelve years and
eight months.&nbsp; No man in the same time ever fought so many
battles, won so many victories, and subdued so many people.&nbsp;
No man, before or since, ever ruled over so many people and such
a kingdom.&nbsp; Queen Victoria is in these things his only
rival.&nbsp; But with his sudden death the fruits of his
victories are re-distributed.&nbsp; His Empire was divided into
four parts; the four Diadochi were his successors.&nbsp; What
lessons may men and nations learn by studying the prophecies!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For prophecy came not in old time by the will of man;
but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost;&rdquo; and unto this sure word of prophecy we do well to
take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is
of any private interpretation&rdquo; (2 Peter i. 20).&nbsp; As
naturally as nature responds to the seasons, so will providence
to prophecy.&nbsp; We can discern Spring-time, Summer, Autumn,
and Winter.&nbsp; The garden will reveal to us Winter as distinct
from Summer, so in interpreting prophecy we must always look for
an agreement between providence and the world.&nbsp; As naturally
as the goat symbolises Alexander, so will providence in natural
history respond.&nbsp; Winter, with its winds, storms, and frost;
with its leafless trees and desolate gardens, proclaim, beyond a
doubt, which season of the four is bearing rule.&nbsp; Such a
thing cannot be of private interpretation; and prophecy, when
fulfilled, is as easy seen, and is not of private
interpretation.&nbsp; A man is as foolish <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>in forging
prophecy as one would be in trying to forge Winter by putting
artificial leaves on trees, and flowers on bushes.&nbsp; The
thing is easily known if we exercise our reason.&nbsp; In this
line of thought we are sorry to note that men have more faith
than reason; hence the blunderings of prophetic writers, and the
leaders of Adventism and Millenarianism.&nbsp; Prophecy
unfulfilled commands and demands our faith&mdash;much more faith
than reason, for it is impossible to see how some things can come
to pass, but if they are subjects of prophecy they surely will,
whether we understand them or not.&nbsp; A prophecy fulfilled,
however, appeals more to reason than faith, for if fulfilled, it
can readily be demonstrated.</p>
<p>As naturally as the female and male birds know each other and
mate together, so will events and prophecy.&nbsp; This kind of
argument Isaiah uses: &ldquo;Seek ye out the Book of the Lord and
read; no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate, for
My mouth it hath commanded, and His Spirit it hath gathered
them&rdquo; (Isa. xxxiv. 16).&nbsp; I charge you to beware of
prophetic dentists who put false teeth in the mouth of prophecy;
who by their haste and impatience forestall prophecy and weaken
men&rsquo;s faith instead of strengthening it.&nbsp; Prophetic
evidence is very strong evidence, both for the Christian and the
infidel.</p>
<p>Some will fail to be convinced when prophecy is
fulfilled.&nbsp; Jew-like, they will blind their eyes and shut
their ears to the evidences and voice of fulfilled
prophecy.&nbsp; The entire career of our Lord Jesus Christ was
foretold and mapped out by the Old Testament writers.&nbsp; Moses
declared His family; Micah the place of His birth; Isaiah the
virginity of His mother; Zechariah His triumphant entry into
Jerusalem; David His life, resurrection, and ascension, with many
other kinds of evidence of a detailed and general character; yet
the Jews, who claimed to be well versed in the Old Testament,
rejected Christ.&nbsp; Keep these things in mind while we now
consider the text more directly.</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>You remember that out of the goat kingdom there came up
four notable ones, and out of one them came forth a little horn,
which waxed exceeding great toward the South, East, and pleasant
land, or land of Palestine.&nbsp; Now this horn is not to be
confounded with the little horn of the fourth kingdom spoken of
in chapter vii., for that horn might justly be called the
eleventh toe horn, as it comes into existence after the ten-toe
kingdoms.&nbsp; The little horn of the text is explained in verse
23 to be a king of fierce countenance.&nbsp; He was to appear in
the latter time.&nbsp; It will be interesting for us to ascertain
what king, people, and country this little horn stands for.&nbsp;
Daniel has given us a very vivid picture of the king.&nbsp; He is
to be of fierce countenance, to understand dark sentences, to
stand up in power and might, not however in his own power; he
will claim to be appointed and authorised of God, and will
pretend to rule in God&rsquo;s name; he will destroy wonderfully
even the mighty of the world and the holy people; he will be very
prosperous and practical, giving a great impetus to trade.&nbsp;
By means of his prosperity he will become proud and strong, and
will destroy many.&nbsp; He will actually stand up in place of
Jesus&mdash;Prince of princes.&nbsp; But finally he will be
broken without a hand.&nbsp; Thus, you see, Daniel gives us
twelve special features of his person and reign.&nbsp; Without
doubt the mate of these descriptions will be found on the person
of Mahommed, and his successors in religion Mahommedanism, and in
people and country the Turks and Turkey.</p>
<p>Mahommed had his religion and himself recognised about the
year 622 at Mecca.&nbsp; From that time and place he went forth
to waste and to destroy.&nbsp; As his religion prevailed, so he
subdued the country or territory.&nbsp; He united in himself the
rights and prerogatives of king, priest, and prophet, making it
obligatory upon his followers to prepare a way and enforce his
religion by the sword.&nbsp; He was indeed a king of fierce
countenance.&nbsp; Thus sprang Mahommedanism and the Turkish
nation <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>into existence.&nbsp; As a people,
they are chiefly the descendants of Esau and Ishmael.&nbsp; If
one desires to know the history and final destiny of this people,
let him study the prophetic utterances concerning Esau and
Ishmael.&nbsp; They are the descendants of Abraham, and so they
very naturally fall into the prophetic line.</p>
<p>The Hungarians came from this family through Lot.&nbsp; The
Poles and Magyars are from Moab and Ammon.&nbsp; These things
being so, it is no wonder the Hungarians and Turks should
sympathise, nor that England should have a liking for Turks,
England being the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.&nbsp; Alliance and
sympathy between England and Turkey has a deeper root and meaning
than some are willing to admit.&nbsp; Turkey, however, as a
distinct empire, is nearly at an end.&nbsp; The recognition of
the Ten Lost Tribes, and their restoration with the Jews to
Palestine, is connected with the downfall of Turkey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Saviours are to come up on Mount Zion to judge the Mount
of Esau, and the kingdom shall be the Lord&rsquo;s&rdquo;
(Obad.).</p>
<p>How clearly speaks Obadiah again when he says, &ldquo;How are
the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought
up!&nbsp; All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even
to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have
laid a wound under thee; there is none understanding in
him.&nbsp; Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord, even destroy
the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the Mount of
Esau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the latter times of the king of fierce
countenance.&nbsp; Hear Daniel inquiring of the angel in this
vision, &ldquo;How long shall be the vision concerning the daily
sacrifice and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?&nbsp; And he
said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; These days are generally allowed to stand for
years.&nbsp; If so, Jerusalem was destroyed <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>70 <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; The time Daniel saw this vision
was about 490 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; take 70 from this
leaves 420.&nbsp; From 2,300 take 420, and we have 1,880.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
means this?&nbsp; It means Jerusalem will recur back again into
the hands of the Jews and Israel.&nbsp; Christ said that the Jews
&ldquo;should fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away
captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled&rdquo;
(Luke xxi. 24).</p>
<p>Now we know the Jews did fall by the sword when the Romans
took Jerusalem.&nbsp; Second, we know they were scattered among
the nations.&nbsp; Third, Jerusalem has been trodden under
foot&mdash;so much so, that Christians have not been permitted to
stand on Mount Zion, where now stands the Mosque of Omar.&nbsp;
And this is the city of the great King.&nbsp; This is Mount Zion,
from which is yet to go forth the law.&nbsp; This is Jerusalem
that God promises to yet again make the chief place of the
earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Arise, shine, for the light is come, and the
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; When, we ask,
will the fulness of the Gentiles come in?&nbsp; We answer,
Soon.&nbsp; Think of what God has taught us in His Word.&nbsp;
We, as the Lost Tribes, have indeed been ignorant of our origin
and destiny.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I would not, brethren, that ye
should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in
your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel,
until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in&rdquo; (Rom. xi.
25).&nbsp; This time is nicely pointed out by John in Rev. xi. 2:
&ldquo;But the court which is without the temple leave out, and
measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles, and the holy
city shall they tread under foot forty and two months;&rdquo; or,
as explained in the following verse, a thousand two hundred and
three-score days.&nbsp; Accepting a day for a year again, and we
have 1,260 years.&nbsp; Taking Mahommed power to date from 622,
or about, then 622 and 1,260 make 1,882.&nbsp; Now just as sure
as Jerusalem is now trodden under foot, as certainly will it be
free.</p>
<p><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on
thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for
henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised
and the unclean.&nbsp; Shake thyself from the dust; arise and sit
down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O
captive daughter of Zion&rdquo; (Isa. lii. 1, 2).</p>
<p>England is appointed of God to take possession of Palestine
and restore Jerusalem.&nbsp; God has told us through Isaiah that
He will lay vengeance upon Edom by the hand of Israel.&nbsp; The
many days of the vision of Daniel are now gone; the time is
nearly up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Zion&rsquo;s sake will I not hold My peace, and for
Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness
thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a
lamp that burneth; and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness,
and all kings thy glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the duty of the
watchmen of Zion to discern the signs of the times and become
obedient unto heavenly instruction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye that make
mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give Him no rest till
He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the
earth&rdquo; (Isa. lxii. 1, 2, 6, 7).</p>

<p class="gutsumm">PROPHETIC WONDERS&mdash;TWENTY MARKS OF THE
MONSTER&mdash;THE BERLIN CONGRESS&mdash;ANTI-CHRISTS
MANY&mdash;MISTAKES BY WRITERS.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I considered the horns, and behold! there
came up among them another little horn, before whom there were
three of the first horns plucked up by the roots; and behold! in
this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking
great things.&rdquo;&mdash;Daniel vii. 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the visions and dream recorded by Daniel in this chapter we
have the same subject matter as that contained in the dream of
Nebuchadnezzar of the metallic image.&nbsp; In this the subject
is carried further into the future, bringing to view some new
items of interest, under different symbols and more of
detail.&nbsp; The four kingdoms of the metallic image are in this
dream presented by the symbolism of four beasts.&nbsp; Babylon by
a lion which had eagle&rsquo;s wings, setting forth the strength
and swiftness of the same.&nbsp; Persia by a bear raised up on
one side.&nbsp; Persia at this time was composed of Media as
well, but the one-sided position of the bear denotes the dying
out of Media and the continuance of Persia.&nbsp; The same idea
is conveyed in the eighth chapter and third verse: &ldquo;The ram
had two horns, and one was higher than the other, and the higher
came up last.&rdquo;&nbsp; Media was a kingdom before Persia, but
Persia was to survive Media; all this history confirms.&nbsp;
After the Medo-Persian Empire declined, Persia surviving, held on
to Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt&mdash;that is, when the bear was
raised up on one side, it held in its mouth three ribs, and was
strong for a time.</p>
<p>The Macedonian Empire Daniel saw under the type of a leopard,
which had on its back four wings of a fowl; the beast also had
four heads.&nbsp; Babylon was represented by two wings, <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>but
it is very fitting that Alexander and his empire should have four
wings, for no conqueror ever flew so fast over the earth as this
same monarch.&nbsp; In the metallic image he is represented by
brass, in this by a leopard, and in the one we noticed in
Discourse VII., by the goat.&nbsp; How wonderfully appropriate
are these symbolisms.&nbsp; The four heads of this leopard stand
for the four kingdoms into which the Macedonian Empire was
divided on the death of Alexander&mdash;namely, first, Egypt
under Ptolemy; second, Syria under Antigonus; third, Asia Minor
under Lysimachus; fourth, Greece under Cassandar.&nbsp; These
four kings were the four leading generals of Alexander.</p>
<p>The fourth beast of this vision is a nondescript; for among
all the animal creation there could not be found one that could
suitably represent Rome.&nbsp; But one was made for the purpose,
combining in itself all that is fierce and terrible.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and
strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and
brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it; and
it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it
had ten horns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its teeth were of iron and its claws
of brass.&nbsp; What a monster!&nbsp; The other beasts faithfully
represented their respective kingdoms, and so did this.&nbsp;
What a record!&nbsp; What a counterpart we have in history of
this beast!&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in
the streets of Askelon,&rdquo; lest the Pagan rejoice, and the
heathen mock at us, and the infidel triumph over us.&nbsp; Blot
out from Time&rsquo;s record the 24th of August, 1572.&nbsp; Let
not our children learn the name of St. Bartholomew, for fear they
should despise Christianity.&nbsp; Quench the flames of
Smithfield, destroy the Inquisition, and divorce Christianity
from such a kingdom, from such a beast.&nbsp; Thank heaven! the
beast is dying; its teeth are worn to the very gum by the
gnawings of centuries; its claws are not now sharp, so it cannot
now crush the innocent, as in days gone by, nor tear with its
brass claw the weak.&nbsp; Though the beast is growing old and
weaker, yet let us remember <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>that its
death struggle is yet to come.&nbsp; The beast has been wounded,
but this shall only serve to intensify its rage.&nbsp; To be
forewarned is to be forearmed, if we are wise.</p>
<p>This beast, Daniel tells us, had ten horns, and these horns
are ten kings&mdash;that is, kingdoms&mdash;that shall
arise.&nbsp; Just here we may reasonably ask whether these ten
kingdoms are yet in existence, and the answer is, No.&nbsp; Some
of them may be; of course they are in existence, as was General
Grant before the war, but not yet distinct or assigned their
special work and place.&nbsp; The time, however, for them all to
appear is near at hand.&nbsp; Of this we may rest satisfied, when
once they are all in existence we will have no difficulty in
knowing them.&nbsp; Prophecy unfulfilled is always more difficult
to interpret than when it is fulfilling or fulfilled.&nbsp; We
have no doubt but some of these horns are in existence, and from
what we can glean from prophecy and history, some are not yet in
their proper place.</p>
<p>The special province of prophecy is to prepare us for what is
coming.&nbsp; Searching into prophecy enables us to forecast the
future with tolerable certainty, just as the scientists can
tolerably forecast the weather by studying the laws, forces, and
inclinations of nature.&nbsp; So the Christian student, by
studying prophecy, Providence, and history, and comparing them,
can know much of what is coining.&nbsp; On the Divine side all
prophecy is certain, but on the human it can only be
approximated.&nbsp; Prophecy furnishes the strongest kind of
evidence in favour of the existence of God&mdash;inspiration of
the Scriptures and Providence.&nbsp; The Lord Himself calls our
attention to this kind of evidence frequently in the Bible.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Produce your cause, saith the Lord; bring forth your
strong reasons, said the King of Jacob.&nbsp; Let them bring them
forth and show us what shall happen; let them show the former
things what they be, that we may consider them, and know the
latter end of them; or declare us things for to come&rdquo; (Isa.
xli. 21, 22).</p>
<p>Prophecy does not interfere with the coming to pass of an <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>event, or suppress man&rsquo;s freedom no more than the
man at Washington, who gives us the weather probabilities, makes
the weather or regulates nature.&nbsp; Even when men know the
sequence of a thing they oftentimes persist in doing it.&nbsp;
The soldiers who wrangled at the cross about the dividing of the
garments of the crucified One, thought little and cared less for
prophecy; but when they came to the Saviour&rsquo;s vest, they
fell into the line of prophecy, for at once they cast lots for
that, all of which had been fore-written for hundreds of
years.&nbsp; Run and tell that young man that the place he is
entering is the way of death.&nbsp; Tell him that the air is
foul, that the furniture and painted humanity are all gotten up
to deceive.&nbsp; Tell him that in a few years he will repent
ever having seen such a place.&nbsp; And what is your
reward?&nbsp; It is that you are laughed at and esteemed as one
that interferes, and told to mind your own business.&nbsp; The
young man is free and self-confident.&nbsp; Look in a few years
for that same young man and you shall find him a terrible example
of fulfilled prophecy.&nbsp; Diseased, worn, weak, and weary, he
cries in the anguish of soul for his folly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And thou
mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, and
say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
reproof?&rdquo; (Prov. v. 11, 12).</p>
<p>The famous European Congress which met in Berlin, we foresaw
would meet, near three years ago, and told you the conditions
under which it would be called.&nbsp; In the dark days of the
past did we not repeat to you our faith, as fostered from
prophecy, that England could not go to war?&nbsp; Many of you,
and persons in different parts of the country, advised me by
letter when the telegraph despatches came crowding and
threatening, that I had so said.&nbsp; The intention was to break
my faith, or at least to remind me that I had not spoken
correctly.&nbsp; What now? who is right?&nbsp; This Congress
completed a prophetic period.&nbsp; After it was over new scenery
appeared and a new act came upon the stage.&nbsp; But more of
this by-and-bye.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Among the results of this Congress will be an
enlargement of England&rsquo;s power over Turkey and Egypt.&nbsp;
For England must possess Constantinople, because to Israel it is
promised that he shall possess the gates of his enemies, and this
is one of the finest gates in the world.&nbsp; Palestine will
come into the hands of England, and be opened up for the return
of the Jews, who, when the time comes will go in multitudes, and
the Lost Tribes representatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take you
one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to
Zion&rdquo; (Jer. iii. 14).&nbsp; In a few years men will
understand why, in this country, as well as in England, people
are hunting up their genealogy, and by tradition, history, and
heraldry, trying to ascertain of what family they are.&nbsp; The
re-settlement of Palestine by God&rsquo;s chosen people, the Lost
Tribes, no one can deny who reads and believes the Bible.&nbsp;
Hanging upon the fulfilment of this great fact are many other
prophecies and events, which are of great interest to the Church
and the world.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; The ten-toed kingdom must be formed.&nbsp; These
kings are to form an alliance with the beast, or Church of Rome,
as representative of this beast.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the ten horns
which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom
as yet, but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.&nbsp;
These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto
the beast&rdquo; (Rev. xvii. 12).&nbsp; Thus strengthened, the
beast will make war with the saints, or chosen, but it will be
her final struggle, for in struggling she will die.&nbsp; These
ten kings will forsake her.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; Anti-Christ has to appear after the settlement of
Palestine.&nbsp; Anti-Christ is represented by the other little
horn spoken of in the text.&nbsp; This little horn is to come
forth from one of the ten horns.&nbsp; He, too, will ally with
the beast.&nbsp; The subject of Anti-Christ is a very interesting
one; on it men have written and speculated much and wildly.&nbsp;
In studying a subject of this kind, we should first ascertain the
Scripture teachings on <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>it, then look for the preparative
signs in the Church and world, and finally, for the counterpart,
which, once in existence, no one can fail to recognise.&nbsp; The
time, person, and work of Anti-Christ have been very clearly set
forth in the Old and New Testaments, especially by Isaiah, in the
fourteenth chapter and twelfth to sixteenth verses; by Daniel in
the seventh and eleventh chapters, under the symbolism of this
little horn; by Paul in second Thessalonians, second chapter and
first to twelfth verses; also by John in Revelation, thirteenth
chapter and nineteenth chapter and twentieth verse, besides many
other references.</p>
<p>Of Anti-Christ the early Christian fathers had different
views.&nbsp; 1st. Some thought that he would be Satan assuming
the appearance of a man.&nbsp; 2nd. Some thought he would be a
hybrid, the offspring of Satan by a harlot; of this opinion were
Lactantius and Sulspitius.&nbsp; 3rd. Hilary, Jerome, and others
thought he would be Satan incarnated.&nbsp; 4th. Chrysostom,
Theopolact, and Theodoret thought he would be a real man under
the influence of the devil.&nbsp; This latter view we accept as
being the nearest to the Scripture teaching.&nbsp; In the
Scriptures he goes by the names of Lucifer, man of sin, son of
perdition, and that wicked one.&nbsp; Now all these names are
indicative of some special feature of his character.&nbsp; Man of
sin points out the intensity of the person in wickedness.&nbsp;
As some time ago a man was called &ldquo;the wickedest man in New
York,&rdquo; so Anti-Christ will be called the man of sin, having
been the greatest sinner of human kind.</p>
<p>From the Scriptures we find that he will be characterised by
some twenty peculiarities.&nbsp; These we will just enumerate: a
cunning seducer, a vile imposter, a bold blasphemer, a great
tyrant, a wonderful organiser and diplomatist; hence he will
readily make alliances with other kings and strengthen himself; a
pretentious and hypocritical Communist, dividing his lands,
money, and treasure among the people; he will be very ambitious
and aspiring, doing or being anything so he may gain his point;
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>he will be very self-willed; he will be very boastful,
speaking great words; he will be very cruel, not heeding the plea
of woman; he will be very sacrilegious, sitting in the temple of
God&mdash;that is, the new temple, built by the returned
Jews&mdash;and actually claim to be God; he will be a scientific
spiritualist, able to work miracles, even to bring fire down from
the clouds; he will be very powerful by his alliance, apparent
generosity, and scientific deception; he will be a great liar,
making treaties and breaking them whenever it suits him; he will
be very wicked, guilty of all manner of crime; his reign will be
short as a king, only about three-and-a-half years.&nbsp; Before
this he will have been a man of power and position.&nbsp; He will
suddenly be destroyed in the time of a fearful uprising of the
people; he will remain unburied in the streets of Jerusalem for a
time, then, finally, his remains will be burnt up.&nbsp; These
and many other facts inspiration furnish us beforehand of this
most wonderful character.</p>
<p>Against this person our Saviour warned the Jews and all the
Church, but especially the Jews, and He did so for special
reasons, which will appear hereafter in this discourse.&nbsp;
Christ said, &ldquo;I am come in My Father&rsquo;s name, and ye
receive Me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye
shall receive.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the time of Anti-Christ&rsquo;s
death there will be raging a fearful war, and coincident with
this war there will be another Saint Bartholomew massacre in
several of the ten-toed kingdoms.&nbsp; The beast and Anti-Christ
are to be destroyed about the same time.&nbsp; It will be the
last plot of the Jesuits, who are hounding to death poor Leo.
XIII.&nbsp; A glimpse of that time the Saviour showed to His
disciples, when He said: &ldquo;For then shall be great
tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world, to
this time, no, nor ever shall be; and except those days should be
shortened, there should no flesh be saved; but for the
elect&rsquo;s sake those days shall be shortened.&nbsp; Then, if
any man shall say unto you, Lo! here is Christ, or there, believe
it <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>not; for there shall arise false Christs, and false
prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that,
if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&nbsp;
Behold!&nbsp; I have told you before&rdquo; (Matt. xxiv.
21&ndash;25).</p>
<p>What a warning the Saviour gave the Jews, but how little have
they and the Church heeded it!&nbsp; In the second century
appeared the famous Bar Cochebas, with his thousands of
followers, who in his final struggle was slain with some sixty
thousand of his adherents.&nbsp; Also, think of Antiochus
Epiphanes and his terrible delusions, the thousands and tens of
thousands who flocked to his standard.&nbsp; So marvellous was
this delusion, that many have actually made him out to be
Anti-Christ, but those who thus reason take the shadow for the
substance, and do violence to all true Scripture exegesis.&nbsp;
Antiochus Epiphanes could not be Anti-Christ, for he was out of
time, and meets but few of the special conditions of
Anti-Christ.&nbsp; History records the appearance of not less
than twenty-five Anti-Christs, or persons who have claimed to be
the Messiah of the Jews.&nbsp; How unbelief exposes a man or a
people!</p>
<p>Some have laboured to make it appear that Mahommed was
Anti-Christ, but with all his badness, he is not bad enough to be
Anti-Christ.&nbsp; He reviled not God, he never sat in His
temple, he did not die in Jerusalem.&nbsp; He had an honourable
burial.</p>
<p>Some have tried to prove that Romanism and the Pope were
Anti-Christ, but this cannot be, you will see at a glance.&nbsp;
The beast has its own character; that was long ago written out by
the prophets, and up to the present time it has filled in the
outlines with a marvellous minuteness.&nbsp; In these things many
good and wise men have erred in making prophecies fit certain
persons, and nations, and times, instead of waiting for these
things to fit on to prophecy.&nbsp; Let us not be prophetic
forgers.&nbsp; Let no one deceive you in these matters.&nbsp;
Adventism, Millerism, Shakerism, Spiritualism, are untimely
excesses.&nbsp; As systems they are, as yet, out of place.&nbsp;
This subject of Anti-Christ, <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>as to who
he will be, and when he will appear, I shall be obliged to leave
for next Sunday evening, as my time is up.&nbsp; May the good
Lord guide us into the ways of truth and peace.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let no man deceive you by any means; for
that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first,
and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
that is worshipped, so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God.&rdquo;&mdash;2 Thess. ii. 3,
4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may reasonably ask why Paul gave the Thessalonians this
caution, and the answer will appear at once if we read his first
epistle to this people.&nbsp; There you will find Paul writing to
them about the second coming of Christ, which writing the
Thessalonians had evidently misunderstood, and this
misunderstanding was working mischief among them.&nbsp; They had
false hopes and expectations.&nbsp; Their faith, instead of
exciting them to holy activity in Church and State, had begun to
paralyse all their efforts.&nbsp; &ldquo;For this we say unto you
by the word of the Lord, that <i>we</i> which are alive and
remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which
are asleep; for the <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Lord Himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the
trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first (that is,
before Christ descends); then <i>we</i> which are alive and
remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to
meet the Lord in the air; and so shall <i>we</i> ever be with the
Lord&rdquo; (1 Thess. iv. 15&ndash;17).&nbsp; It was the frequent
use of the pronoun &ldquo;we&rdquo; that had confused
them&mdash;<i>we</i> who remain, <i>we</i> who are alive.&nbsp;
The Thessalonians had inferred from this that the second coming
of Christ would take place in their day.&nbsp; Hence, to correct
this impression Paul thus writes in his second epistle.&nbsp; The
two verses preceding the text show us Paul&rsquo;s intent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto Him, that ye be
not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor
by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is
at hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then comes in the text, &ldquo;Let no man
deceive you,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>In reasoning on such important subjects as Anti-Christ,
resurrection, and second coming of Christ, we should always be
mindful of the Scriptural order.&nbsp; When we sit down to take
dinner, we follow the order that custom has prescribed, soup,
fish, meats, and dessert.&nbsp; Children, however, if let alone,
would reverse this order by beginning with the dessert
first.&nbsp; So with many Christians, they reverse the order of
things as laid down in the Bible.&nbsp; They make Christ to come
before Anti-Christ, and Anti-Christ to come before the Jews and
Ten Lost Tribes are gathered together again and settled after
their first estate in Palestine.&nbsp; The Millerites could
neither have deceived themselves nor others had they taken
knowledge of the relation of things.&nbsp; The Jews and Lost
Tribes had not been gathered together then, the temple had not
been built in Jerusalem, as described in the last chapter of
Ezekiel, neither had Anti-Christ appeared.&nbsp; But such was the
folly of men then, and not less now than then.&nbsp; Four-fifths
of the prophecies of the Bible refer <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>to the
history of Judah and Israel in their own land, their captivity
and return in the latter day.&nbsp; Still men take one-fifth and
confuse themselves and everybody else.&nbsp; They have brought
the prophets and prophecy into bad repute by ignorantly or
wilfully interpreting the same.</p>
<p>We freely avow now that the prophecy fulfilling at present is
the finding of the Lost Ten Tribes, then their union with the
Jews, then their restoration to Palestine, then after being
settled there for some time, the Jews, as Jews, having built
their new temple, and having established the Mosaic temple
service again, and the Lost Tribes as Christians, then and there
we may look for Anti-Christ&mdash;not before.&nbsp; Not for the
sake of boasting, and yet without fear, we freely invite
ministers or laymen anywhere to disprove these facts, and to such
we will respond cheerfully if asked for farther proof.&nbsp; The
Lost Tribes, we believe, are come to light, and may be found in
the Saxon race chiefly as represented in this country and Great
Britain.&nbsp; If this be so, then we may look for the
preparatory signs in Providence and nations, and thank Heaven,
these are at hand and in accord with the Divine Word.</p>
<p>In Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s metallic image we saw Rome
symbolised by the legs, composed of iron and clay.&nbsp; We saw,
also, that the little stone cut out of the mountain began its
destructive assault on the image, by striking the feet; these it
would first break, so Rome politically has disappeared.&nbsp; The
ten toes, however, symbolised ten kings or kingdoms that were to
arise in the latter day, or at the time of the end.&nbsp; These
ten kingdoms are also symbolised in Daniel&rsquo;s dream by ten
horns that came out of the head of the nondescript animal that
stood for Rome.&nbsp; It is out of one of these ten horns that
another little horn grows, having eyes like a man and a mouth
speaking great things&mdash;that is, Anti-Christ.&nbsp; It is at
once plain, then, that ere Anti-Christ can appear, these ten
kingdoms must be formed.&nbsp; How, when, and where will these
ten kingdoms be formed?&nbsp; <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>The clay
part of Rome is still alive, and is designated by Daniel, and by
John in Revelation, under the name of beast; and here you need to
be careful, for the word beast is sometimes given to Anti-Christ,
so as not to confound it with the word beast when it stands for
the Romish Church.&nbsp; They will be formed out of Spain, Italy,
France, and part of Austria.&nbsp; Edom, Moab, and the sons of
Ammon in Austria, are to be free&mdash;that is, the Poles,
Magyars, and Hungarians.&nbsp; The setting up of these ten
kingdoms will begin in France by a revolution.</p>
<p>By the doctrine of infallibility, these countries are claimed
by Rome, and wedded to her, and this doctrine of infallibility
makes a divorce impossible.&nbsp; Rome waits only her time to
reclaim her supposed own.&nbsp; And this doctrine of
infallibility will make it a holy war, hence good and true
Catholics everywhere will be obliged to sustain the same by their
money, or presence, or prayers.&nbsp; This, to many of our
Catholic friends, will sound strange.&nbsp; But this they know,
if such an emergency ever does arise&mdash;they cannot well fight
against the infallible Church&mdash;between commands and duties,
they will readily prefer the Pope and Church to king and
country.</p>
<p>The Jesuits are now, and have long been, preparing for such an
event: they expect it.&nbsp; By their plottings and intrigues
they will again, as many times before, involve the Church in
war.&nbsp; They are busy sowing the seeds of discord.&nbsp; In
past time both the Church itself and nations have banished these
crafty fellows from their pale and country.&nbsp; The United
States alone, of the nations of the earth, is the only one that
has not so done.&nbsp; But even among us they are plotting and
man&oelig;uvring to such an extent that it will not be long
before America will be tested and tried on this same subject.</p>
<p>Among the preparatory signs of the coming of Anti-Christ we
have Communism, which is destined to spread.&nbsp; In Europe it
will unsettle every throne but one&mdash;that is, Israel,
England.&nbsp; We fear that neither the Church nor State
comprehend the <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>terrible power that is thus quietly
organising in this and other lands.&nbsp; It is this uprising of
the Communists and intriguing of the Jesuits in our own land,
that will call General Grant once more to the front, as we
pointed out to you months ago.&nbsp; The recent European Congress
resulted in patching up a temporary peace between Russia,
England, and Turkey.&nbsp; A place will be provided for the Duke
of Edinburgh, who, having married the Czar&rsquo;s daughter, will
enable the two Powers to agree.&nbsp; He may not be the first
prince, still he and his seed are to find a kingdom in that
place.&nbsp; Russia will be willing for England to have
Constantinople, and exercise a provisional protectorate over
Turkey, with a view of strengthening his daughter&rsquo;s
chances.&nbsp; England will thus come peaceably in possession of
Palestine.</p>
<p>Germany, being tied to both the Russian and English thrones by
blood and marriage, will also freely consent.&nbsp; Besides,
Germany is going to pass through a severe trial.&nbsp; The old
Emperor will soon die, and also Bismarck, then a new prince will
advise the new king, new counsel, and new blood, near and on the
throne.&nbsp; Germany will become a prey to internal strife,
fanned by the discontented Catholics of the Empire, that number
some 15,000,000, and weakened by the Communistic elements.&nbsp;
Not much longer can Germany bear the strain of her immense army
and enormous taxes in consequence.</p>
<p>Russia also will have all she can do to stay the desire for
reform, and the claims of the Nihilists or Communists.&nbsp; Thus
will Providence prepare His people&rsquo;s way back to
Palestine.</p>
<p>If God promises once He does so fifty times, that He will
restore Israel and Judah to their own land.&nbsp; To this one
thing all Providence is concentrating, and this is the key that
unseals prophecy and Providence.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I will cause
the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and
will build them as at the first&rdquo; (Jer. xxxiii. 7).&nbsp;
They will form a free province, electing their own rulers and
governors.&nbsp; They will be quite <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>democratic,
doing away with all titles, being the children of the Lord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
shall proceed from the midst of them&rdquo; (Jer. xxx. 21); or,
as stated by Isaiah, chap, i, verse 26, &ldquo;And I will restore
thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the
beginning; afterward thou shalt be called, The city of
righteousness, the faithful city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus they will be
a free province, managing their own affairs under the patronage
and protection of England.&nbsp; Now it is this freedom that will
open the door and prepare the way for Anti-Christ.&nbsp; He will
be elected governor because of his supposed superiority in
manners, science, and benevolence.&nbsp; He will appear as a lamb
at first, according to John, but once in power his true character
will appear.&nbsp; He will be a great scientist, and in the eyes
and faith of the multitude He will be able to work
miracles&mdash;to bring, scientifically, fire down from
heaven.&nbsp; So clever will he be that he will deceive some of
the very elect.</p>
<p>Before his election he will have been a man of great power and
influence.&nbsp; Once in power he will contrive to centre all
power and interests in himself.&nbsp; He will pander to the
Communists&mdash;to the Romish Church&mdash;to the scientific
infidels of the day.&nbsp; In this feature he will draw heavily
upon the Germans, and create quite a sympathy in England and this
country.&nbsp; &ldquo;For some of them of understanding shall
fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white even to
the time of the end&rdquo; (Dan. xi. 35).</p>
<p>The Scriptures having pointed out the special features of his
character, we see that many of these features are already in the
world.&nbsp; This is Anti-Christ.&nbsp; This is the spirit of
Anti-Christ.&nbsp; And when God withdraws His restraining power,
Anti-Christ will embody all these forces and characteristics in
himself.&nbsp; And all men having these features, will sympathise
with him, and aid him.&nbsp; God alone is now keeping back and
down this spirit of Anti-Christ until His own chosen time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>ye know what withholdeth, that he
might be revealed in his time; for the mystery of iniquity doth
already work, only he who now letteth will let until he be taken
out of the way (that is, till God withdraws Himself), and then
shall that wicked be revealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anti-Christ means one opposed to Christ.&nbsp; Also it means
one opposed to Christ, and yet desires to be Christ&mdash;who
wishes to be received as Christ.&nbsp; And when the time comes,
he will be received by many.&nbsp; The Jews will be looking for,
and expecting the coming of, their Messiah, hence many of these
will be deceived.&nbsp; Many radical Adventists and Millenarians
will accept him, because they are in haste in their expectations:
many of these will follow him.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole world
seems ripe to furnish him a quota.&nbsp; But who will he
be?&nbsp; Answer: He will be a French Jew, who will intermarry
into the Bonaparte family.&nbsp; His title will be Napoleon I. of
Palestine.&nbsp; This word Napoleon, resolved into Greek
equivalents, is equal to Apollyon, and as a number stands for
666.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is wisdom.&nbsp; Let him that hath
understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number
of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six&rdquo;
(Rev. viii. 18).</p>
<p>Christ, when warning the Jews of Anti-Christ, said, &ldquo;I
am come in My Father&rsquo;s name, and ye receive Me not; if
another shall come in his own name, him ye will
receive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, and in other discourses, we have to
content ourselves at many points with mere statements, for to
defend every point would take too long a time, and would not suit
our purpose.&nbsp; It is our desire in all these discourses to
incite you to study, to teach you to examine for yourselves; to
prepare you against being unduly led away by Adventism,
Communism, or Infidelity; to give you an interest in Providence
and history.&nbsp; Do you ask if any will be led away by such a
false pretender?&nbsp; We answer, Yes&mdash;unless humanity
undergoes some radical change.&nbsp; Take a few
instances:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Our Shaker friends believed in Mother Ann Lee.&nbsp;
This woman in 1770, while living in Manchester, England,
pretended to have a special revelation from Heaven, making known
unto her that she was the female side of Christ&mdash;as Jesus
was the revelation of the male side.&nbsp; As Eve was taken out
of Adam, the female principle separated from the male, so she was
separated from Christ.&nbsp; This, and much that is curious, do
these sincere, honest, and industrious people believe.</p>
<p>Take another example, nearer home, and of which some of you
are cognizant, having known the pretender and many of his duped
followers.&nbsp; We refer to Matthias, the prophet of Westchester
County.&nbsp; This pretended lord began his labours in Albany,
N.Y., in 1830.&nbsp; First he taught himself to be God&rsquo;s
high priest, then the Saviour, then he claimed to be God.&nbsp;
On being asked where he was from, he would answer: &ldquo;I am a
traveller, and my legal residence is Zion Hill, Westchester
County, New York State.&nbsp; I am a Jewish teacher and priest of
the Most High God, saying and doing all that I do, under oath, by
virtue of my having subscribed to all the covenants that God hath
made with man from the beginning up to this time.&nbsp; I am
chief high priest of the Jews of the Order of Melchizedec, being
the last chosen of the twelve apostles, and the first in the
resurrection which is at the end of 2,300 years from the birth of
Mahommed, which terminates in 1830.&nbsp; I am now denouncing
judgment on the Gentiles, and that judgment is to be executed in
this age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared in fine pontifical robes, with a rule six feet
long in his right hand; with this he was to measure off
God&rsquo;s holy city.&nbsp; In his left hand he had a two-edged
sword.&nbsp; Underneath his pontifical robe he had a rich olive
broadcloth cloak, lined and faced with silk and velvet; besides,
he wore a brown frock coat, with several stars on each breast,
with a splendid gold star on the left.&nbsp; His belt was of
white cloth, fastened by a golden clasp, and surmounted with an
eagle.&nbsp; He wore a cocked <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>hat of
black beaver, trimmed with green, the rear angle being surmounted
by the golden symbol of glory.</p>
<p>He moved from Albany to New York, and here succeeded most
wonderfully, winning over some of the finest families of Fifth
Avenue, and the richest and best merchants of this city.&nbsp;
His followers furnished him with plenty of money, carriages, a
mansion in the city, and one in the country.&nbsp; Finally he was
accused and detected of the worst crimes, and at last was sent to
Sing Sing.&nbsp; While in jail he issued the following
proclamation: &ldquo;As I live, there shall be no more sowing in
the earth until I, the twelfth and last of the apostles, am
delivered out of the house of bondage.&rdquo;&nbsp; For fear of
this proclamation many of the farmers refused to sow, and they
set to work to deliver him, and succeeded.&nbsp; He left the
jail, and may be living yet to read what we now state to you.</p>
<p>It is really wonderful how easily men are deceived in
religious matters.&nbsp; Let us study the Word, ask God&rsquo;s
guidance in knowing and doing His will.&nbsp; Time is gone.&nbsp;
I have said but little, much more might be said.&nbsp; In my next
discourse I will introduce you to two old men who will visit
Anti-Christ.</p>

WITNESSES&mdash;WHO ARE THEY?&mdash;HOW THEY CAN BE

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And I will give power unto My two
witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and
three-score days, clothed in sackcloth.&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. ii.
3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will all agree that the person and work of Anti-Christ are
yet in the future.&nbsp; For while Anti-Christ is ruling in
Jerusalem, and battling with the saints of the Most High, having
conquered and plucked up by the roots three of the ten-horned
kingdoms by his victories and cunning craft, and his alliance
with the beast or the Church of Rome, he will become proud,
blasphemous, and arrogant, and will at once try to force the
people to worship the beast.&nbsp; He will claim to be the
promised Jewish Messiah.&nbsp; He will enter the new Jewish
Temple and actually sit enthroned as God incarnated, commanding
the people to worship him.&nbsp; He will be so received by the
Jews, some of the Israelites and the Romish Church, by the
Communists and scientific infidels, and by &ldquo;such as do
wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
flatteries,&rdquo; men of understanding shall fall; indeed,
Christianity will seem to be about destroyed.</p>
<p>Russia will aid by her influence his pretensions with a secret
purpose to take the spoils and gain her long-desired object,
Jerusalem and Palestine.&nbsp; England will stand aloof for a
time, waiting an opportunity to interfere.&nbsp; Then will be a
time to try men&rsquo;s faith&mdash;to test the Church.&nbsp;
England and America will stand alone as representing freedom and
religious liberty.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then shall many be offended
and shall betray one another, <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>and shall
hate one another.&nbsp; And many false prophets shall arise and
deceive many; and because iniquity shall abound, the love of many
shall wax cold; but he that shall endure unto the end shall be
saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the time when Communism, infidelity,
and Romish Jesuitism will combine against God and liberty, and,
thank heaven, this is the time appointed when they all will be
destroyed.&nbsp; Then the kingdoms of this world will be given to
the saints of the Most High.&nbsp; The struggle will be fierce,
long, and terrible, but victory will be on the Lord&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>In the very midst of these awful times there will appear two
famous persons as witnesses for Jesus: one who will specially
appear to the Jews, the other to Israel, and both testify for God
and Jesus.&nbsp; These two witnesses will turn the tide of
battle, confront Anti-Christ and his host, and give to the world
new views of God and Providence.</p>
<p>These two old men, or witnesses, will be endowed with
miraculous power to bring fire down from heaven, or turn the
water streams into blood, and smite the earth with all manner of
plagues, as often as they will.&nbsp; Their presence and power
will cast a gloom o&rsquo;er the nations of the earth, and
Anti-Christ and his allies.&nbsp; They will finally be slain in
the streets of Jerusalem.&nbsp; At the time of their death a
great feast will be held to commemorate the victories of
Anti-Christ, and to inaugurate the setting up of an image of him
in the temple.&nbsp; So in the city there will be peoples,
kindreds, and tongues of many nations.&nbsp; And they will see
the dead bodies of the two witnesses lying exposed and unburied
in the streets for three days and a-half, for Anti-Christ will
not suffer them to be buried.&nbsp; On the wings of the wind, by
the telegraph and by signals, the news of their death will spread
rapidly abroad to all the nations of the earth.&nbsp; Infidelity,
and Communism, and the Jesuits will be emboldened.&nbsp; Feasting
and rejoicing will be the order of the day.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they
that dwell upon the earth <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>shall
rejoice over them and make merry, and shall send gifts one to
another, because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt
upon the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; That will be the merry wake for
you&mdash;a wake that will suddenly end, and that too, before the
corpses are buried.&nbsp; The victories will be cut short and the
rejoicing checked.</p>
<p>The spirit of life from God shall enter into the two exposed
and corrupting bodies, and they shall stand upon their feet to
defy Anti-Christ and his host, and laugh at the pains of
death.&nbsp; Great fear will fall upon them who saw the dead so
raised.&nbsp; This time the telegraphs will be muffled, and the
news is kept back from the nations as much as possible; but
astonishment ends not here, for over the destroying and now
idolatrous city of Jerusalem hangs a peculiar cloud, and voices
peal as thunder through the air, to call the attention of the
multitudes.&nbsp; And when every eye is skyward, the cloud moves
and opens, as a chariot of fire and glory, and rising in majesty
and composure up above roofs, temples, and pinnacles, will be
seen the two witnesses of Christ; they enter in and are borne
heavenward.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they ascended up to heaven in a
cloud, and their enemies beheld them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, while
the multitude are wrapt in wonder and all amazement, the
pinnacles sway to and fro, the houses rock, the earth trembles,
the walls of the city fall, and Olivet cleaves in twain.&nbsp;
Then Anti-Christ is slain with many of his followers, and the
remnant fear unto repentance.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the same hour
there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city fell,
and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand, and the
remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of
heaven.&nbsp; And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great
voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become
the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign
for ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are some of the wonders yet to come.&nbsp; Then how say
some that Anti-Christ has already been?&nbsp; The witnesses have
<!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>not yet appeared: they have not yet wrought their
miracles.&nbsp; The Lost Ten Tribes and the scattered Jews have
not yet been gathered from all countries whither the Lord God
hath scattered them, and placed in their own land, to go out no
more, to be plucked up no more.&nbsp; Jerusalem is yet being
trodden under foot, the land is comparatively desolate, no temple
yet adorns the city, nor priest, nor Levite, attend at the
altar.&nbsp; Pshaw! upon the Biblical interpreters of this day,
who wilfully or ignorantly careen through the line of prophecies,
despising the order established by God.&nbsp; They are like the
girl with her novel, who cannot wait to read through the book,
and take events in their order, but she turns to the last leaf to
find the destiny of her hero.&nbsp; So men, borne by passion and
choice, skip by several of the prophecies, and harp everlastingly
on the last&mdash;the coming of the blessed Jesus&mdash;&ldquo;He
whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of
all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy
prophets since the world began&rdquo; (Acts iii. 21).&nbsp; The
world is not yet ready for Christ; it is yet too much upside
down, too much confused.&nbsp; But God is in Christ reconciling
the world unto Himself.&nbsp; It does not now look like God; so
God and Christ, Providence and the Church, must work on till the
house is in order for His return.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Hon dei ouranon
men dexasthai archri chronon apokataseos panton</i>,&rdquo; whom,
indeed, heaven must retain until the time of restoration of all
things.&nbsp; If things are not now restored or reconciled, or in
order, why, then, Christ cannot come.&nbsp; He will not come to
put them in order; this He has left for and with the Church to
do, and has promised to be with His Church to the end.</p>
<p>A few Sunday evenings ago, a brother kindly asked me where the
Church would be while Anti-Christ was reigning.&nbsp; I simply
said anywhere and everywhere, wherever it happened to be.&nbsp;
He thought the Church would be taken away by Christ; he referred
me to several passages.&nbsp; I said, Come next Sunday <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>evening, as those passages will be partly considered in
my next sermon.&nbsp; He replied that he might be taken up by
that time.&nbsp; All right, I said, then we will excuse
you.&nbsp; Now, in the name of common sense, why have men, and
why do men, down through the centuries, and now, entertain such
views?&nbsp; Because every Bible reader must see that there are
many prophecies that must be fulfilled before Christ can
come&mdash;one of which is the appearance of the two witnesses of
the text.&nbsp; They will be specially sent and commissioned to
testify for Christ, as against Anti-Christ.</p>
<p>Let us now ascertain who these two witnesses are, or are to
be.&nbsp; I find on examining the subject all manner of views set
forth.&nbsp; And, as is often the case in studying a subject of
this kind, I find few that agree&mdash;so much so, that at last I
found relief in turning from what men said and thought to what
God in His Holy Word had written and said.</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; They are two men.&nbsp; Second.&nbsp; They are
sent to Jerusalem which, because of the wickedness of the city at
the time of their visit, will be called Sodom and Egypt; but,
lest we should mistake the place from these names, John adds:
&ldquo;Where also our Lord was crucified.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Isaiah
i. 10 says: &ldquo;Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom;
give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of
Gomorrah.&rdquo;&nbsp; This fixes safely the place.&nbsp;
Besides, the place is pointed out from the fact that they oppose
Anti-Christ, who at that time we know will be at Jerusalem.&nbsp;
Third.&nbsp; They are sent.&nbsp; You ask where they are sent
from?&nbsp; The answer is, From heaven, from standing before the
God of the whole earth.&nbsp; Fourth.&nbsp; Who sends them?&nbsp;
We answer, Jesus&mdash;because the Book of the Revelation is
&ldquo;the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto
John.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fifth.&nbsp; What were they sent for?&nbsp; In
the first place they were to be special witnesses for Jesus, for
He calls them His two witnesses.&nbsp; In the second place, they
were to prophesy, to be prophets in the fullest sense, to
forecast the future, to <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>interpret
past and present; to work miracles; to assume control in
directing State affairs.&nbsp; Sixth.&nbsp; It is worth your
careful notice to note that they are not constituted witnesses by
being sent; they are sent because they are witnesses.&nbsp; They
are not then to be endowed with miraculous power; &ldquo;these
have power&rdquo; in the present tense.&nbsp; These facts, if
nicely considered, will at once suggest the persons.</p>
<p>Whoever they are, they must have gone from earth to heaven
with their bodies, two persons who have escaped death, for their
death takes place in Jerusalem.&nbsp; They must have been
prophets before they left earth for heaven the first time.&nbsp;
And in the third place, they must at some time and place have
been special witnesses for Christ.&nbsp; In fact, they are two
anointed ones, or, in other words, they are two persons who have
been set apart and prepared for the very visit spoken of in the
text.</p>
<p>Daniel, when speaking of them, and the visit spoken of in the
text, calls one &ldquo;the Ancient of Days;&rdquo; the other one
was &ldquo;like the Son of Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He represents these
two persons as sitting in judgment on Anti-Christ, and the seven
horns, or kingdoms.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the ten horns that were in
his head and of the other which came up, and before whom three
fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake
very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows
(this is Anti-Christ).&nbsp; I beheld, and the same horn made war
with the saints and prevailed against them, until the Ancient of
Days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High,
and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom&rdquo;
(Dan. vii. 20).</p>
<p>Many interpret &ldquo;the Ancient of Days&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;one like the Son of Man&rdquo; to be Christ.&nbsp; They
stagger not at the fact that there are two persons, and that they
are introduced one to another, and that the Ancient of Days seems
to be the greatest.&nbsp; It is nothing to such interpreters that
there are two persons; these they make one.&nbsp; The one looking
like the Son of Man they make out to be the Son of God, although
Daniel says he <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>only looked like Him.&nbsp; The
judgment spoken of by Daniel they make out to be the general
judgment, when, in fact, Daniel tells on what and where they sat
in judgment&mdash;namely, at Jerusalem.&nbsp; About
Anti-Christ&mdash;and that Anti-Christ is soon destroyed after
this&mdash;and &ldquo;as concerning the rest of the beasts (that
is, the seven horns), they had their dominion taken away; yet
their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The vision and scene of the whole chapter belongs to this world,
and the kingdom of the saints here spoken of is as much material
and political as the other.&nbsp; The difference is, the rulers
and people are Christians, they are called saints.</p>
<p>Every throne should be double-kinged; that is God&rsquo;s
purpose, that is Heaven&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; Christ wants no
earthly throne excepting that way.&nbsp; As the Creator is Lord
of lords and King of kings, so Christ after His resurrection
assumed His Father&rsquo;s place, and stands to us as God to the
Jews of old.&nbsp; All power was given to Him in heaven and in
earth, therefore, He, Christ, has long since begun His reign, and
He must continue to reign until He hath put all enemies under His
feet.&nbsp; When David was king over Israel and Judah, so was
God.&nbsp; We repeat, every throne should be double-kinged.</p>
<p>To this end will come these two witnesses.&nbsp; Who will they
be?&nbsp; We answer, Moses and Elijah: these are the two brave
old men now living and waiting to fulfil their mission.&nbsp; For
hundreds of years they have been anointed.&nbsp; Moses is
&ldquo;the Ancient of Days;&rdquo; the &ldquo;one like the Son of
Man&rdquo; is Elijah the Tishbite.&nbsp; This interpretation
chimes in with the Divine Word, without twisting and distorting
to make both ends meet.</p>
<p>We said these two were to be human: so they are.&nbsp; They
being sent from heaven, we said they must have passed by death
with their bodies; so they did.&nbsp; They were to be prophets;
so they are, two of the grandest prophets of all.&nbsp; They were
to have power over fire and water; so they had when they lived on
earth.&nbsp; The bloody stream of the Nile gives witness for <!--
page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Moses.&nbsp; The parched land and time of drought
speaks of Elijah in Ahab&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; They both called
fire down on them who sought to hurt them.&nbsp; They were to be
special witnesses of Christ; so they were on the Mount of
Transfiguration.&nbsp; These two olive trees stood one on each
side of the golden candlestick, Jesus; Peter, James, and John,
testify to having seen Moses and Elijah.&nbsp; These two old
veterans know Christ well, hence they will be sent to testify for
Him against Anti-Christ.&nbsp; Moses is a Jew.&nbsp; He will
appeal unto the Jews, who will be found in the new temple,
performing according to the old Mosaic law.&nbsp; He will change
and lead his people from Anti-Christ to Christ.&nbsp; Elijah is
an Israelite.&nbsp; He will specially bear testimony to the
Israelite, his long-lost, but then restored, brethren.</p>

WITNESSES&mdash;MORMONISM&mdash;GOD RULING AMONG THE
NATIONS&mdash;CAREER OF THE TWO
WITNESSES&mdash;ANTI-CHRIST&mdash;THE THRONE AND HOUSE OF
DAVID.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the seventh angel sounded; and there

are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He
shall reign for ever and ever.&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. ii. 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last Sabbath evening we called your attention to two special
witnesses who are at a given time to appear at Jerusalem for a
specific purpose.&nbsp; At the time of their appearance
Anti-Christ will be reigning with great power and pomp.&nbsp; He
will have <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>succeeded in persuading the Jews and
many others that he is the promised Jewish Messiah; this claim he
will be able to sustain and confirm in the eyes of the multitude,
from the very fact that he will, to all appearance, work
miracles.&nbsp; Nor need we query that such a thing can take
place.&nbsp; Look at some of the facts of our own day, and see
how pliable human nature is.&nbsp; There are millions of people
who sincerely believe that Leo XIII. is God&rsquo;s vicegerent,
and that he is infallible.&nbsp; Take into account the Mormonism
of this day, and see how terrible a thing in the name of
Christianity can be established and maintained.&nbsp; Aye, in the
nineteenth century, and in the United States of America.&nbsp; Or
look in upon the Spiritualists and consider their claims and
pretensions.&nbsp; Thousands upon thousands of them are persuaded
that they are <i>en rapport</i> with heaven and in communication
with spirits and spirit-land.&nbsp; Then you will not be
surprised at the pretensions, claims, and success of
Anti-Christ.&nbsp; In our calm and unprejudiced consideration of
these organisations, we are bound to admit that they have done
more, and owe more for their success, to deception and error,
than to truth and openness.&nbsp; Each in its turn has been
caught in the act of deceiving, and has been frequently exposed,
but of what avail?&nbsp; Truly but little.&nbsp; We do not mean
that in these systems there is no good, for surely there is, but
that the errors and deceptions are of so glaring a kind, that we
wonder that anybody of common sense can be so easily led
astray.</p>
<p>With these facts before us, can we wonder any longer that
Anti-Christ shall be so successful?&nbsp; The very occasion and
peculiar times and incidents of the reign of Anti-Christ will
call for some special manifestations on the part of the Divine
One that shall soberly and clearly confront the hollow and
hypocritical pretensions of that age.&nbsp; Hence the appearance
of the two witnesses&mdash;Moses the Ancient of Days, and Elijah
the Tishbite, who will look like the Son of God.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>Allow us to submit further evidence in proof that the
two witnesses of John in Rev. xi. are none other than Moses and
Elijah: for many passages of Holy Writ are sealed to the
understanding till we comprehend who the two witnesses are, their
mission and work.&nbsp; We will notice the attributive features
of these witnesses as they are related by John in this
chapter&mdash;that is, Rev. xi.</p>
<p>In the first place, there are two persons or individualities;
this appears plainly from the tenor of the whole record.&nbsp;
They are spoken of as &ldquo;they, them, their mouth, their feet,
as dying and being resurrected.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, strange to say,
after all this plainness of speech, men have become so accustomed
to spiritualise and generalise that Anti-Christ stood for Rome,
and naturally enough, having generalised Anti-Christ, they must
do the same with the two witnesses; hence they found them in the
Churches of the Waldenses and Albigenses.&nbsp; In such an
interpretation nearly all the attributive features of these
witnesses are ignored.&nbsp; Such as that they had power to work
miracles, to lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem for three
days and a half.&nbsp; Some have laboured to prove that the Old
and New Testaments were these witnesses, others that they were
symbolised by the law and Gospel.&nbsp; Again, some that the two
sacraments, baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s supper, were these two
witnesses, and so on almost without end.&nbsp; These instances
will suffice for our present purpose; for surely any of you
reading God&rsquo;s own Word need not so blunder.</p>
<p>In the second place, Jesus calls them His two witnesses.&nbsp;
Now, in what sense were they His? for such they are now.&nbsp;
Not that they will be His when they appear, but they will appear
to oppose Anti-Christ at Jerusalem because they are sent.&nbsp;
The prophets are all witnesses; for, as Peter says, &ldquo;To Him
give all the prophets witness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The apostles were
witnesses, and all believers are witnesses for Jesus; yet these
two are so in a special and pre-eminent sense.&nbsp; Let any one
read <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the account of the transfiguration
of Jesus and the circumstances attendant thereon, and all will be
plain.&nbsp; Moses and Elias (another spelling for Elijah) we
find were present, as well as Peter, James, and John.&nbsp; When
Christ was transfigured, &ldquo;Behold there appeared unto them
Moses and Elias&rdquo; (Matt, xvii. 3).&nbsp; These two persons
talked with Jesus, &ldquo;and spake of His decease which He
should accomplish at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, then, they
were special witnesses for Christ, and so they will come again
and witness for Him in the time appointed.</p>
<p>The number of days we must take in a literal sense; here the
1,260 days and 3&frac12; days are the days appointed for their
work and death.&nbsp; It is well to remember that many of the
prophetic numbers contain a double prophecy.&nbsp; Thus 1,260
here may be coincident with the treading down of Jerusalem by
Mahommedanism.&nbsp; But whether it is or not, does not vitiate
the literal quantity when applied to these two witnesses.&nbsp;
In the third place, they are called two olive trees and two
candlesticks standing before the God of the whole earth.&nbsp;
The figurative meaning will be found by finding some passage
where two trees are mentioned in the interpretation
given&mdash;such a passage by Zechariah iv.&nbsp; Here the
prophet saw two olive trees and asked of the angel the meaning;
and the angel said, &ldquo;Knowest thou not what these
be?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I said, &ldquo;No, my Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then said he, &ldquo;<i>These are two anointed ones</i> that
stand by the Lord of the whole earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The simple
meaning is, that the two olive trees mean two persons, who are in
heaven at present, but are anointed&mdash;that is, set apart,
selected for some distinct work for God.</p>
<p>Moses and Elijah evidently were anointed and specially
selected, for it is probable they both escaped death.&nbsp; The
wonder connected with the disappearance of Moses and the
translation of Elijah now finds some measure of
explanation.&nbsp; None doubt the translation of Elijah.&nbsp;
John the Baptist was not Elias, except he was to go before Christ
in the spirit <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>and power of Elias; in this sense
John stood for Elias.&nbsp; John the Baptist prepared the way of
Christ the first time, so will Elias for Christ&rsquo;s second
coming.&nbsp; The record of Moses&rsquo;s departure from this
world is as mysterious as it is dramatic.&nbsp; But, certainly,
neither the mysterious nor the dramatic have any meaning
excepting we allow something Divinely special.&nbsp; To die as
other people, would mean nothing on the line of specialities; but
he did not so die.&nbsp; He went from the people alive; no one
saw him die or dead.&nbsp; He went up into Mount Horeb and never
returned.&nbsp; So, so far as the people were concerned, he was
to them a dead man, for he went from them no more to
return.&nbsp; The word death in Hebrew has not less than six
meanings, one of which is simply to disappear.&nbsp; This is the
meaning that we must attach to the death of Moses.&nbsp; Neither
his grave nor body have ever been found.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar passage in the book of Jude where
&ldquo;Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil, he
disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a
railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, Satan then had power over death in some way Divinely
permitted.&nbsp; Paul says (Heb. ii. 14), speaking of Christ,
&ldquo;Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that
through death He might destroy him <i>that had the power of
death</i>&mdash;that is, the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; When God was
translating Moses, passing him by death, Satan fought with
Michael, who was God&rsquo;s messenger, to inflict the sting of
death on Moses, and although Michael carried Moses on by death
into the presence of God, Satan durst not bring a railing
accusation against him.</p>
<p>Jude, in his epistle, probably quoted from one of the now lost
books of Revelation, which was entitled, &ldquo;The Ascension or
Assumption of Moses the servant of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church
father, Origen, makes mention of this work, but, like the book
and prophecies of Enoch, from which Jude makes a quotation, <!--
page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>it has been lost, they having served their
purpose.&nbsp; The fairest and most generous interpretation,
then, is, that Moses did not die the ordinary death, but
disappeared, was, in fact, translated, anointed, and set apart
for a special work in connection with his own people, the Jews,
in the days of the coming Anti-Christ.&nbsp; Thus, without any
trouble, he could appear with Elijah on the Mount of
Transfiguration.&nbsp; And it is worthy of note that before he
disappeared in Horeb&mdash;the sacred writer is mindful to tell
us &ldquo;Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he
died&mdash;<i>his eye was not dim nor his natural force
abated</i>&rdquo; (Deut. xxiv. 7).&nbsp; But, supposing Moses
died naturally, there is nothing unreasonable or irregular in
concluding that God resurrected him as a mortal for future
use.&nbsp; True, he will die again as a witness; so there are in
heaven now eight persons who have died twice in this
world&mdash;namely:</p>
<p>The child raised by Elijah (1 Kings xvii. 21).<br />
The child of Elisha (2 Kings iv. 35).<br />
The Moabite soldier who came to life on touching the bones of
Elisha (2 Kings xiii. 21).<br />
The daughter of Jairus (Luke viii. 55).<br />
The widow&rsquo;s son at Nain (Luke vii. 15).<br />
Lazarus of Bethany (John xi. 44).<br />
Dorcas or Tabitha by Peter (Acts ix. 40).<br />
Eutychus by Paul (Acts xx. 10).</p>
<p>Anti-Christ will be a great electrician; electricity by that
time will be a fearful power in the hands of science.&nbsp;
Edison with his genius and marvellous discoveries, and others of
like gifts, will have perfected the use of this agent in a
wonderful degree.&nbsp; Anti-Christ will make use of this power
to cower his enemies and bring them in fear-subjection.&nbsp; He
will bring fire down from heaven.&nbsp; The two witnesses,
however, will be clothed with Divine power; they will be able to
bring fire by a simple command&mdash;this they both understood
and used when on earth.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Moses called fire down upon the 250 rebellious
Korahthites, as we read in Numbers xvi.&nbsp; Ahab, the King of
Israel, thought to punish and compel the obedience of Elijah; but
God gave fire from heaven in answer to the prophet&rsquo;s
prayer.&nbsp; So when Ahaziah sent a captain and fifty men to
bring Elijah into the king&rsquo;s presence, they found him
sitting on the top of a hill and commanded him to come
down.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Elijah answered and said to the captain of
fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven,
and consume thee and thy fifty.&nbsp; And there came down fire
from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty&rdquo; (2 Kings i.
10).&nbsp; Thus will these two anointed ones be able to contend
with Anti-Christ and all the powers of scientific infidels.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If any man hurt these two witnesses, by the very means
used so shall they be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in
the days of their prophecy, and have power over waters to turn
them to blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; To whom would these gifts and
attributes apply better than to Elijah, who in the days of the
wicked King Ahab sealed the heavens against rain for three years
and a half? and to Moses, who, when contending with Pharaoh,
turned the sweet flowing Nile into a stream of blood?&nbsp; What
two prophets had such a wide range of prophetic energy and
liberty as Moses and Elijah?&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Well may the
Revelator say, then, of them, that they can smite the earth with
all manner of plagues as often as they will.</p>
<p>By awful and sublime manifestations the world shall see that
God rules in the heaven and on the earth.&nbsp; They shall learn
that Anti-Christ is a false Christ.&nbsp; Then shall fear and
repentance fall upon the people.&nbsp; The Jews shall be
convinced, and converted, and persuaded by the appearance of
their beloved Moses.&nbsp; They shall know of a truth that the
Messiah has been, and is waiting to come again.&nbsp; Referring
to that time the prophet Zechariah calls it a time of trembling,
the time of a terrible siege.&nbsp; But he tells us that
&ldquo;The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>first, that the glory of the House of David, and the
glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, do not magnify themselves
against Judah.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we learn that the Jews, who have
been so long despised and bereft of a king, country, and
government, shall see through the great mystery of Providence
first.&nbsp; The House of David is found in the royal family of
England.&nbsp; The Jews, seeing this, will invite, in concert
with all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the English Government to
take charge of their affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall the children of Judah and the children of
Israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one
<i>head</i>&rdquo; (Hosea i. 2).&nbsp; The Jews will then be
Christians.&nbsp; &ldquo;For they shall look upon Him whom they
have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourneth for
his only son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time the whole world will be amazed and confounded at
the destruction of Anti-Christ and his host.&nbsp; The Jews, the
House of David, and the Lost Tribes, Israel, the Saxons, will
hold a council in Jerusalem.&nbsp; David&rsquo;s house, which God
selected, and throne, both of which the Almighty promised
perpetuity to, shall be found and recognised in the English
throne and royal family.&nbsp; The Saxon race shall distinctively
appear as long-lost Israel.&nbsp; So that the Jews, and
David&rsquo;s House, and Israel, will unite and acknowledge
Christ as Lord and Master.&nbsp; They will make known to America,
who stands for Manasseh, and all the colonies, the decision of
the said council; all parties will see, and accept, and federate
for the world&rsquo;s conquest and peace.</p>
<p>This federation of the ancient people, the literal seed of
Abraham, will cause jealousies and alliances on the part or rest
of the world, excepting some portions of France, Austria, and
Prussia.&nbsp; The beast, dragon, and Anti-Christ&rsquo;s force,
that will survive the shock of the two witnesses, will all unite
for an onslaught upon England, but especially Palestine.&nbsp;
Russia, though nominally Christian, will join the beast or Romish
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Church.&nbsp; The dragon means the Pagan portion of the
world.&nbsp; Thus will be inaugurated the battle of Armageddon,
the issues of which we are permitted to know through
Revelation.&nbsp; Then will the kingdoms of this world become the
kingdoms of our Lord and His Christ.</p>
<p>With many, and to many, these things are but as dreams; they
are chimerical.&nbsp; But one thing is certain: the history of
the Church and Providence in the future are appallingly
grand.&nbsp; Providence was grand in leading forth His people of
old from Egypt.&nbsp; But He will be no less grand when He shall
set His hand a second time to recover His people as He has
promised to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will
raise unto David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and
prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the
earth.&nbsp; In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall
dwell safely, and this is His name whereby He shall be called,
The Lord our Righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; (That is, the ruler of
God&rsquo;s choice&mdash;a king, then, in fact, by Divine
right.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
Lord, that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought
up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, The Lord
liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the House of
Israel out of the North country, and from all countries whither I
had driven them, and they shall dwell in their own land&rdquo;
(Jer. xxiii. 68).</p>
<p>God has now one of the seed of David on the throne, and He has
a Jew doing her bidding, executing her decrees over and for
Israel.&nbsp; For though Israel were to be numerous and powerful,
yet to David&rsquo;s seed belongs the throne.</p>
<p>The recent Congress was but a forerunner of the one yet to
come.&nbsp; The crownless king, Disraeli, who forced the
Congress, is, perhaps, an unconscious instrument in the hands of
Providence.&nbsp; But whether he be or not, he is hastening on
the day with lightning speed.&nbsp; Forth from the recent
Congress he goes, having once again linked the destinies of
England to the <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Continent, which has been so
strangely severed, till Russia, Italy, Austria, France, and Spain
might each test the other, and each find their appointed
place.&nbsp; Now, again, England pledges herself a Continental
Power&mdash;nay, more&mdash;an Asiatic Power.&nbsp; She will come
forth from the Congress the virtual ruler of Turkey, the owner of
Palestine.</p>
<h2>BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON.<br />
<span class="smcap">Discourse</span> XIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">THE COMBATANTS ON BOTH SIDES&mdash;WHO
&ldquo;THE KINGS OF THE EAST&rdquo; ARE&mdash;THE GREAT
NAPOLEONIC IDEA&mdash;DISRAELI, LINCOLN AND
GRANT&mdash;ENGLAND&rsquo;S POLICY IN TURKEY&mdash;FUTURE WARS
AND INTRIGUES&mdash;THE GREAT BATTLE-FIELD&mdash;GATHERING OF THE
NATIONS&mdash;EARTHQUAKES&mdash;JERUSALEM A SEAPORT.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And He gathered them together into a place
called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. xvi.
16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christian students and prophetic writers are generally agreed
on three things touching this great event.&nbsp; First, that
there is to be such a decisive battle fought.&nbsp; Second, that
it will take place in some part of Palestine.&nbsp; Third, that
this great struggle will be final, the end of war, the beginning
of the Millennium morn.</p>
<p>In the Scriptures the contestants are pointed out, as they
rally under the standards of the <i>dragon</i>, the beast, and
<i>Anti-Christ</i> on one side, and on the other, under the
standard of David, will be the <i>called</i>, the <i>chosen</i>,
and the <i>faithful</i>; or, in other words, the Ten Lost Tribes
as found chiefly in the Saxon race, with all who sincerely
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>In another sermon we pointed out to you the plain fact
of the existence of David&rsquo;s throne and David&rsquo;s seed
as found and seen specially in the throne of England.&nbsp; We
there see how faithfully God has kept His promise to David and
His people.&nbsp; For God frequently told David that his throne
should be established unto all generations, and of David&rsquo;s
seed there should never be wanting a man to sit thereon.&nbsp; It
is the permanence, the grandeur, and progressive character of
this throne and people that make it a fitting type of Christ and
His Church.&nbsp; Nay, more, it is on this throne that Christ now
sits, so far as this world goes; and it is through this people
that He reigns, and He will and must reign until He has conquered
a universal peace.&nbsp; It is a delusion too long entertained by
the Church to think that David&rsquo;s throne and seed have not
now, nor for centuries had, an existence.&nbsp; It is a delusion
that we should not entertain for a moment to think that the Ten
Tribes of Israel are lost for ever, or that their work or mission
is fulfilled.&nbsp; As surely as the Two Tribes, Judah and Levi,
now exist, fulfilling and filling in the outlines of prophetic
history, so surely are Reuben, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan,
Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh in
existence, answering the purpose of an all-seeing Providence.</p>
<p>Who are the kings of the East spoken of in the
Scriptures?&nbsp; We answer, They are the royal ones of the House
of David.&nbsp; The word king, both in Hebrew and Greek, means
such.&nbsp; This seed God chose, and made them royal by that very
selection.&nbsp; They have been away from their own land,
Palestine, wandering and dwelling in the West.&nbsp; But God in
Providence is preparing a way for their return.&nbsp; In
connection with the pouring out of the sixth vial upon the great
river of the Euphrates, or upon Turkey, as most writers agree,
the waters are to dry up&mdash;that is, Turkey is to decay, to be
absorbed.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; &ldquo;That the way of the kings
of the East might be prepared&rdquo; (Rev. xvi. 12).</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>These kings have been away from the East, and their
return is assured, and the preparation for such return is to be
seen at this time and in connection with the decay of
Turkey.&nbsp; If Turkey, as symbolised by the river Euphrates, is
drying up, then these kings must be advancing Eastward; and so
they are.</p>
<p>The crownless king, Disraeli, who, like many other men God has
raised up, is for these times an index finger pointing out the
way of Providence.&nbsp; He is a receptive agent of Divine force,
to the intent that he may interpret a Divine purpose.&nbsp; He
may know, or he may not know, that he is so directed of
heaven.&nbsp; The prophets of old were seldom permitted to
interpret or understand their own prophecies.&nbsp; If they
asked, like Daniel, the meaning, they were told to &ldquo;go
their way,&rdquo; for oftentimes the words were &ldquo;closed up
and sealed until the time of the end.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder this
man, against all England nearly, and to the amazement of all the
world, proclaims the Queen of England the Empress of India, for
the way of the kings of the East must be prepared.</p>
<p>Napoleon Bonoparte&rsquo;s grand idea was to prepare the way
of the kings of the East and make himself and his descendants
these kings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Conquer England and the world is
ours,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; But when his secret and well-prepared
assault on England was revealed and frustrated by a chain of
providential events, he hit upon another plan to get possession
of Palestine.&nbsp; Seventy years ago he invited all the leading
Jews of the world to a secret council in Paris; he wished them to
aid him in getting possession of Palestine.&nbsp; He pretended to
want their return.&nbsp; He gave them certain privileges and
laboured to procure more from the other nations; he did much for
the Jews in enlarging their liberties and taking away from them
the curse of society.&nbsp; The one idea that is distinctly
Napoleonic, is to possess Palestine.&nbsp; The late Napoleon had
his idea, and in his day this idea had become a part of France;
so much so, that France thought herself to be then and now the
real protector <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>of Palestine.&nbsp; It was for this
idea that she allied with England and Turkey in the Crimean
war.&nbsp; It was to keep Russia back from possessing the holy
places.&nbsp; Not till France was weakened could England advance
on her way East rapidly; so Germany was used to destroy her
prestige and cause her to stand aside till England proceeds on
her way homeward.</p>
<p>It was a comely sight, some five years ago, to see two Jews
closeted together making a secret bargain&mdash;one had power,
the other had money.&nbsp; The man of power asked the man of
money to lend him twenty million dollars; it was done.&nbsp; At
once the man of power purchases with this twenty millions part of
his fatherland back again&mdash;the Suez Canal.&nbsp; This very
canal is on the boundary of the land of Palestine as given to
Abraham centuries ago.&nbsp; By this very route the old patriarch
entered the Promised Land.&nbsp; It was fitting, indeed, that
this should be the first piece purchased back.&nbsp; No one knew
save those directly interested.&nbsp; England murmured and France
protested, but the thing was done.&nbsp; Poor France, bleeding
and divided, could do but little; for Disraeli and Rothschild had
done the work.&nbsp; The way of the kings of the East must be
prepared.&nbsp; So on they go.&nbsp; A man who executes a Divine
purpose is always strong.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln, in the history
of our country, was so chosen and led of God.&nbsp; The
politicians, and statesmen, and generals, and many of the people
were against him at first; but the Lord was with him, so he
marched on to victory, the country following in the wake.&nbsp;
And though dead, not forgotten, the country and the civilised
world are marching on after him, and now they have nearly
overtaken him.&nbsp; Lincoln&rsquo;s ideas and the
country&rsquo;s are nearly equal.&nbsp; A man led of God is
generally a good distance behind, and the people led by such a
man are equally as far behind him as he is behind God.&nbsp; But
this nation and Abraham Lincoln are now one, and in those things
in which they once were divided they are a unit, with more than
the honoured Lincoln; for they are a unit with God and
providence.&nbsp; <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Thus follows the English nation in
the wake of Disraeli, and the world is coming on behind, and the
day will come when all will be a unit.&nbsp; It does not shock
our idea of human honesty much when we learn that this crownless
king played a double game with Russia and Turkey.&nbsp; It is
intensely Jewish, but if it were only Jewish, then it would be
very detestable; it is more, it is Divine in part.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had the princes of this world known, they would not have
crucified the Prince of Glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had the princes of
the late Berlin Congress known the double game being played by
one of the quietest of their number, they would not have done as
they did.&nbsp; Turkey in Asia was given over to England&rsquo;s
protection, aye, yes, that included Palestine.&nbsp; The island
of Cyprus is given over entirely&mdash;surely the way of the
kings of the East is being grandly prepared.</p>
<p>Why did not the Congress hand over to England&rsquo;s
protection Turkey in Europe?&nbsp; For reasons good and
sufficient.&nbsp; Turkey in Europe will be the cause of much
strife, of several wars, and of strange alliances; hence it would
not have done for Israel-England to be mixed up with it.&nbsp;
Constantinople alone, of European Turkey, England will
keep.&nbsp; Israel is to be much preserved from war, until the
great battle of Armageddon comes on.&nbsp; Against that time she
will have to husband her strength and resources.&nbsp; It is
marvellous now to think that what the Congress settled as
belonging to England, none dispute&mdash;all is peace.&nbsp; But
Russia&rsquo;s share and Austria&rsquo;s are in arms.&nbsp;
Servia, Greece, Roumania, and all the Turkish provinces rebel and
are in a state of disquietude, that portends war and strife again
in a few years.&nbsp; But England will have nothing to do with
it, excepting that Russia and Austria, with the consent of
Germany, Italy, and France, are to set a precedent for England,
which in a few years she will need.&nbsp; It is plain that if
Russia and Austria can force by arms the conditions of the Berlin
Congress, England will be at liberty to do the same without any
<!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>interference even from France.&nbsp; The Congress
handed over to England&rsquo;s keeping Turkey.&nbsp; England,
then, can make Turkey do her bidding by force of arms sustained
by the very precedent already set.&nbsp; Thus will Israel-England
open up Palestine for Christian settlement.&nbsp; The Mahommedans
will murmur and resist to have the holy places taken from them,
but no matter; England, when the time comes, will enforce
it.&nbsp; It is just here that Turkey and England will dispute,
and in each dispute England will find a reason for drawing the
lines a little tighter around poor Turkey.</p>
<p>The contestants on one side at the great battle of Armageddon,
you remember, are the dragon, the beast, and Anti-Christ.&nbsp;
Now what people is represented by the term dragon?&nbsp; We
answer, the Pagan nations and authorities, just as the Chinese
have on their standards to-day a dragon, as we have the
eagle.&nbsp; The Mahommedans, Hindoos, Brahmins, Buddhists, and
all Pagan idolaters, are summed up in the word dragon.&nbsp; At
present, England is tolerant with the subjects and adherents of
these different worshippers and religions; but the time will come
when she will no longer tolerate the same; thus will they arraign
themselves against her in the battle of Armageddon.&nbsp; This
will come to pass as the gradual destruction of Mormonism in our
country.&nbsp; This system has been fortified by law; now laws
are being arraigned against it.&nbsp; It is now only tolerated,
and in a short time it will be wiped out of existence.</p>
<p>The final battle referred to in the text is to occur at a
place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon, the literal meaning
of which is at the mount of Megido.&nbsp; In olden times there
was a city called Megiddon; it stood in what is now called the
great plain of Esdraelon&mdash;a plain that lies midway between
the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean.&nbsp; It was also
called Jezreel.&nbsp; The prophet Hosea speaks of this place,
battle, and time, all by this one word.&nbsp; Referring to the
time when the children of Judah and of Israel are gathered
together under one <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>head in their own land, he says,
&ldquo;For great shall be the day of Jezreel&rdquo; (Hos. i.
11).&nbsp; It is spoken of in the Scriptures and history as the
valley of Jehoshaphat, because here Jehoshaphat, the King of
Judah, gained a great victory; for here the Lord fought against
the enemies of Israel, as He will in the coming battle.&nbsp;
Joel iii. 12 says, referring to this coming struggle, &ldquo;Let
the heathen be waked up and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat:
for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is one name given to this time and battle that is very
significant and striking.&nbsp; Have you ever noticed it?&nbsp;
If not, let me call your attention to it.&nbsp; It is called
&ldquo;That great day of God Almighty,&rdquo; by John in the
chapter of the text.&nbsp; The day of the Lord of hosts by
Isaiah.&nbsp; Ezek. xxx. 3: &ldquo;Howl ye!&nbsp; Woe worth the
day!&nbsp; For the day of the Lord is near: it shall be the time
of the heathen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Joel says, &ldquo;Multitudes,
multitudes, in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is
near in the valley of decision.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the prophets
Amos, Obadiah, Zephaniah, Zechariah, Malachi, and apostles Paul
and Peter, it is called the day of the Lord.</p>
<p>You ask if this battle may not have taken place.&nbsp; We
answer, No.&nbsp; Of such a battle we have no record.&nbsp;
Again, it will be the end of the war&mdash;the final overthrow of
Paganism, the beast, and Anti-Christ.&nbsp; Malachi says,
&ldquo;Behold I will send you the prophet Elijah before the
coming of that great and dreadful day of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Elijah has not yet been a witness.&nbsp; At the time of this
great battle nature is to take a wonderful part.&nbsp; As when
Christ was on the cross, the sun darkened, the rocks rent, the
mountains shook, so in connection with this battle there shall be
some strange wonders&mdash;earthquakes, thundering, lightning,
hail and fire.&nbsp; The Mount of Olives will divide; the valley
of the Dead Sea will fill with water and join to the
Mediterranean; Jerusalem will become a seaport; an appointed
centre from which, being central to all the world, will go <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>forth the ships of the Lord.&nbsp; The city of
Jerusalem, between this time and that, will be considerably
enlarged, then it will divide into three parts.&nbsp; At the time
of this dividing John says, &ldquo;That the cities of the nations
are to fall&rdquo;&mdash;London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, St.
Petersburg, and many others&mdash;that all may turn to Jerusalem,
the capital appointed of Heaven.</p>
<p>If you wish to know more of the particulars of this day, read
the prophets, study what John the Revelator says under the sixth
vial and sixth seal.&nbsp; With awful grandeur and with terrible
majesty have the sacred writers set forth this day and time.</p>
<p>That this day will come, who will deny?&nbsp; Look at the
world ripening for this day.&nbsp; Here, in our own land, as well
as others, the forces are maturing, the agents are at work.&nbsp;
Many of the events of the past year we were permitted to forecast
by looking into the future through the prophets, and onward yet
we look.&nbsp; And the events coming are neither less in number,
merit, or force, than those passed.&nbsp; Keep the events of
prophecy in their proper order lest they confuse you.&nbsp; The
Jews and Ten Lost Tribes are to be found and possess Palestine
before this battle.&nbsp; Anti-Christ is to appear.&nbsp; The two
witnesses, Moses and Elijah, are to appear.&nbsp; And Jesus, our
beloved Master, will not come till the world is settled long in
perpetual peace&mdash;till the house is prepared for the bride,
then shall He come.&nbsp; But with lightning speed events are
crowding on along the ages.&nbsp; The accumulative forces of
centuries are pressing hard upon time present.&nbsp; The time of
the end is near&mdash;not the end of time, but the time appointed
of God in which certain great things are to be
accomplished.&nbsp; Eighteen hundred years ago John cried out,
&ldquo;Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river
Euphrates.&nbsp; And the four angels were loosed, which were
prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year&rdquo;
(Rev. ix. 14).</p>
<p>The Turkish Power originated on the banks of the
Euphrates.&nbsp; <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>It first was divided into four
Sultanies&mdash;namely, Bagdad, Aleppo, Damascus and
Cesarea.&nbsp; These are typified under four angels.&nbsp; Their
time was to be 396 years and a fraction&mdash;an hour, day,
month, and year.&nbsp; Thus, taking a day for a year, 365 for the
year, thirty for the month, one for the day, and we have
396.&nbsp; So from the taking of Bagdad by the Turks in 1057,
which was the overthrow of the Saracens, until the capture of
Constantinople in 1453, which overthrew the Greek Empire, we have
just 396 years.&nbsp; And the time for the drying up of Turkey is
at hand; and so it comes to pass.</p>
<p>Dear friends, how wonderful are the dealings of our God!&nbsp;
Can we shut our eyes to His Divine revelation?&nbsp; Let us be
wise in the day of grace, taking heed to the sure Word of
prophecy, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.&nbsp; The
world indeed is dark, and all confusion.&nbsp; But His Word shows
unto us order in all this confusion, blessed be His name.&nbsp;

<p>Last Sunday evening we considered the subject of the great
battle of Armageddon.&nbsp; This evening we will take up the same
subject for further consideration.&nbsp; This battle, we learn,
is to be very terrible, such a one as the world has not
had.&nbsp; Fearful as some of the wars of the past have been,
this will overshadow them all in skill, fierceness, number,
slaughter, devastation, and wide-spread ruin.&nbsp; It will, in
some respects, be like one of the wars of olden times.&nbsp; For
in this struggle God is again to take a direct part, as He did
for His people Israel and Judah in times of old.&nbsp; Again
shall the forces of nature do battle for God and His people;
again they shall be full of instinctive revenge.&nbsp; Hear us,
and believe us, Denis Kearney, Providence will then &ldquo;pool
the issues&rdquo; of the <i>called</i>, the <i>chosen</i>, and
the <i>faithful</i>.&nbsp; The called are the Jews, the chosen
are Israelites, and the faithful embrace all of every nation who
believe in Christ.&nbsp; Then many will wade in pools of blood
and perish.&nbsp; The birds of prey are to hold high carnival on
the dead bodies of the slain.&nbsp; The spirit of Satan, that now
worketh in the children of disobedience, will pool the issues of
hell and death in the hosts of the <i>dragon</i>, <i>beast</i>,
and <i>false prophet</i>.&nbsp; For though these three powers are
diverse in their aims, professions, and intents, yet we learn
from many passages of the Divine Book that they will join hands
and agree upon a common policy, federating together <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>that they may contend with the called, the chosen, and
the faithful.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I saw three unclean spirits like
frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth
of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.&nbsp;
For they are the spirits of devils working miracles, which go
forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to
gather them to the battle of that great day of God
Almighty&rdquo; (Rev. xvi. 13, 14).&nbsp; Here indeed will be a
pooling of the issues, a pooling that will divide the whole world
into two forces or parties.</p>
<p>Now the canvass has begun, preparations are going on, party
lines are being drawn, powers are concentrating, and men are
rallying under their respective standards, getting the world ripe
and ready for the coming generations, into whose hands the
destinies of that day will be cast.&nbsp; Few of us now living
can personally take part in that final battle, excepting as we do
so by impressing the unborn millions with our ideas.&nbsp; Like
as David prepared the material for the building of the temple,
and his son Solomon carried forward the same, so the work of this
generation is simply preparatory, and that of the coming will be
executive.</p>
<p>Several wars will take place before that of Armageddon, which
in their nature will be fierce and terrible.&nbsp; Still these
will all be preparatory&mdash;leading on to the day of decision
and the battle final.&nbsp; On this point many err, and their
error has a pernicious influence on the Church and the
world.&nbsp; They interpret the preparatory signs as if they were
final; hence the end with such is too near.&nbsp; A sincere
anxiety takes possession of their soul, which utterly unfits them
to judge aright the signs of the times and tokens of
Providence.&nbsp; Thus were a portion of the Advent Church thrown
into confusion the 8th of last July because they had fixed upon
the seventh as the time for the ending of the world.&nbsp; And
human folly and haste will repeat itself again on the 10th of
April next, because another portion of the Advent brethren have
fixed upon the 9th of April as the time of the <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>end.&nbsp;
It is a wonder the first did not take the 4th of July instead of
the seventh, for then a stranger might think the end was nigh in
some of our cities; or why didn&rsquo;t the other party select
the 1st of April, for no doubt it would have proved a more
propitious day?&nbsp; But thus it is, and will be again before
the appointed time of Heaven comes.&nbsp; Man is a creature of
haste and sudden impulse, especially so in his religious
experience.&nbsp; Kings and nations, Churches and sects, have
laboured hard in times past to force the issues of Providence and
give speed and certainty to times and events.</p>
<p>The prophecies affecting our days are clear; so much so, that
he who runs may read, if need be.&nbsp; But an impatient activity
urges men on, bedazzling their eyes, which at once unnerves and
unfits them for reading or judging.&nbsp; &ldquo;In your patience
possess ye your souls,&rdquo; said the blessed Master to His
disciples of old, and not less through them unto us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order is Heaven&rsquo;s first law,&rdquo; it has been
said; and surely order pervades the prophecies.&nbsp; But the
pulpits in general over-ride this order, and are not slow to
malign such men as Edward Hine, of London, England, when the fact
is, that his theory of the prophecies and mode of interpretation
are vastly more natural, responsive, and reasonable than the
ill-adjusted, unnatural, and non-responsive system of current
theology.&nbsp; A person is under obligation to use that key for
the unlocking of prophecy which fits the best, and that responds
to providential events the most natural, without regard to the
antiquated systems and mode of Church, sect, or college
theology.&nbsp; Hine&rsquo;s theory, as it is called sometimes,
is as much superior to the old system of interpretation, as the
railway Pullman car is to the ricketty old stage coach.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxon Israel theory neither destroys or introduces
any new principle, but discovers and applies that which had been
long hidden.&nbsp; The introduction of steam and electricity did
not destroy or produce any new principle, but simply <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>discovered and applied, in an improved form, that which
had been in the world from Adam down till now.</p>
<p>As men in science, mechanics, and practical life, throw
overboard men and things of the past, so should we in theology,
Church life, and experience, when we can do better.&nbsp;
Reverence for persons, and respect for ideas, should not enslave
us.&nbsp; Let us move on, doing better and better.&nbsp; We do
not care to believe all the theology of a Martin Luther.&nbsp;
When we can make an advance on men, or theories, we should do
so.&nbsp; Bacon and Newton are now in part rejected, without
intending, or in fact doing them any dishonour or
disrespect.&nbsp; So are Calvin and Wesley, on the same
principle, by every good theologian.&nbsp; If a theory be
advanced that opens up the Scriptures, and especially the
prophecies, better than those before existing, let the pulpit
accept it, throwing aside its mawkishness and age-intrenched
stupidity.&nbsp; I have no hesitation to say, after over
twenty-five years of experience with preachers and pulpit, that
the majority of preachers are lazy and indifferent in
study.&nbsp; For this reason many of them are deterred from
examining any new theory.&nbsp; Many have said to me, and written
to me, that if they accepted the Lost Tribe theory it would
destroy nearly all their old sermons, and necessitate the making
of new ones&mdash;a work they were not willing to
undertake.&nbsp; It will, therefore, be a long time before the
pulpit is reformed.&nbsp; In these days there are many
strikes.&nbsp; While in Canada, on my vacation, I agreed to
lecture for a Church choir on the prophet Jeremiah&rsquo;s visit
to Ireland.&nbsp; But some preachers banded together and stopped
it; and, in consequence of it, the choir struck and refused to
sing the following Sunday.&nbsp; Passing by this strike, I really
wish the laymen would strike and call the pulpit to an account
and rouse it from its lethargy, and demand that it should
untrammel itself and be free and equal to the age and
demand.&nbsp; I have met with miserly persons who didn&rsquo;t
believe in beautiful churches, or the missionary cause, or any
cause indeed that wanted money.&nbsp; <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>They would
argue for plainness, and so on.&nbsp; The secret of their
peculiar ideas on these matters was to be found in their
stinginess and their love of money.&nbsp; They advocated such
theories because it saved them from contributing.&nbsp; Like a
man I met with on my vacation tour who said that he saved forty
dollars a year by pretending to be angry with the minister or
some of the deacons when they came round collecting money.&nbsp;
Some ministers, no doubt the majority of them, talk about holding
on to the old landmarks and being orthodox for the very reason
that to make a move implies labour, which they are not willing to
give, hence they prate about orthodoxy and landmarks as a pretext
to cover over their indifference.&nbsp; He is the most orthodox
who searches after the truth and keeps up with the age.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Prove all things, hold fast that which is good,&rdquo;
says Paul.&nbsp; These pretended followers of Paul say:
&ldquo;Prove nothing, hold fast what you have got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is as plain as A, B, C, that the Bible teaches the return
of the Jews and Ten Lost Tribes of Israel to the land of
Palestine.&nbsp; Also, that after they are settled in this land
Anti-Christ appears.&nbsp; The dragon and beast are already in
existence, but Anti-Christ is not; the spirit of Anti-Christ
is.&nbsp; When Israel and Judah are settled and prosperous in the
old fatherland, then is to come on the battle of
Armageddon.&nbsp; Thank Heaven! that though the struggle will be
awful, it will be final, and victory will turn on the
Lord&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Then will be set up a kingdom that shall
endure in abiding peace and prosperity for at least a thousand
years.&nbsp; The world will nestle in regaling plenty and great
assurance.&nbsp; This kingdom is to be set up in the latter days
of the four kingdoms spoken of by Daniel.&nbsp; By this we
understand that these kingdoms will have their day, and by
succession, after a time, run out.&nbsp; These
kingdoms&mdash;namely, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and
Rome&mdash;are now disappearing.&nbsp; Rome, politically, is
gone, Persia will soon be absorbed, also Greece.&nbsp; Babylon,
being continued in <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>the Empire of Russia, has yet a
glorious future before it for the next fifty years or so, then
she will disappear to rise no more.&nbsp; The cry will go forth,
&ldquo;Babylon is fallen.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
image you will remember that the stone cut out of the mountain
began to destroy the metallic image upward, hence these kingdoms
will disappear in reverse order to their origin.&nbsp; First
Rome, which has gone; next Greece, which is nearly gone; then
Persia, and then Russia.&nbsp; The new kingdom will fill the
world.&nbsp; Already it foreshadows the outlines of possession by
its immense territory of to-day.&nbsp; Then a scion of the House
of David shall be enthroned in Jerusalem.&nbsp; All the other
great capitals will have been destroyed.&nbsp; It is surprisingly
grand to read of that day, king and kingdom.&nbsp; Let me read to
you a few verses from Jeremiah, chapter xxiii.: &ldquo;Behold,
the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a
righteous branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall
execute judgment and justice in the earth.&nbsp; In His days
Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is
His name whereby He shall be called: the Lord our
Righteousness.&nbsp; Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
Lord, that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought
up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, The Lord
liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the House of
Israel out of the North country, and from all countries whither I
had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words, &ldquo;that day,&rdquo; are often
used, and if we desire to know when that day is, we have data in
the great fact that it is the other side of Armageddon, and
Armageddon is the other side of the settlement of Israel and
Judah in Palestine.</p>
<p>I wish, just here, to correct many of you, as well as some of
the public journals.&nbsp; Of late I have frequently seen it
stated in the papers that I predicted the end of the world in
1882.&nbsp; And many persons have actually asked if I did really
think so.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is, in my sermons on the
Great Pyramid <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>I pointed out to you the remarkable
fact that the Grand Gallery was 1,882 inches long.&nbsp;
Beginning with the birth of the Saviour, these inches stand for
years.&nbsp; This gallery suddenly ends, excepting that it is
continued in a narrow passage, the narrowest in the whole
building, for fifty-three inches.&nbsp; Then comes the
King&rsquo;s Chamber, which before you enter, you pass under a
portcullis in the form of an olive leaf.&nbsp; In this chamber
all is equal, quiet, and central.&nbsp; Now, what I believe this
pillar of witness in Egypt teaches (see Isa. xix. 19) is, that in
1882 the whole world will enter upon a time of great trouble,
war, pestilence, and famine, and for fifty-three years these
troubles will continue more or less.&nbsp; Then about 1935 will
occur the battle of Armageddon, which will be the finishing
touch, the end of wars.&nbsp; I arrive at this, when I follow the
teachings of the Pyramid, by adding 1882 and 53, which gives me
1935.&nbsp; Even then the world will not end, but only begin the
millennium morn, which will last for a thousand years or
more.</p>
<p>Now corresponding to these facts are the events of
Providence.&nbsp; As when Spring is nigh we know by certain
signs, so we know from the Scriptures, Providence, and Pyramidal
teaching, where we stand and the season we are in.&nbsp; &ldquo;O
ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky, but can ye not
discern the signs of the times?&rdquo; said Jesus to the proud
and critical Pharisees and learned and doubting Sadducees.&nbsp;
These parties affected to be specially wise and discriminating in
their knowledge of the times and seasons, and interpreting the
prophets and writings of Moses.&nbsp; Yet their conduct betrayed
their ignorance, for they saw not the end of that grand old
prophetic age, nor the fading symbolism of the temple, nor the
departing glory and decay of their nation.&nbsp; They knew not
the fulness of the time in which they lived, though it bulged out
like a mountain.&nbsp; They did not know that <i>one time hath
ended</i>, another <i>time begun</i>, for they still dated their
documents 4032 of the world, when it was the year of our Lord and
their Lord 32.</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>The antediluvians stand condemned because they were
willingly ignorant of the Providential tokens and signs of the
times.&nbsp; They set at naught the teachings and warnings of
Noah, and in exulting pride they rejected the idea of a special
Providence.&nbsp; Their faith, like many in this day, was planted
and nourished by the laws of nature, and the analogous
continuance of the same, not accepting the doctrine of a Divine
Providence.&nbsp; They cried aloud, &ldquo;Where is the promise
of His coming?&nbsp; For since the fathers fell asleep, all
things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you, like the Jews of old, demand more signs, when those
given you are not understood, or, if understood, they are
undervalued?&nbsp; The prophets have been lavish in portraying
the calamities of the <i>last days</i>, or the times into which
we are entering.&nbsp; For the words <i>last days</i> are the few
years preceding the battle of Armageddon.&nbsp; The calamities of
these days are of four kinds: First, social disorders; second,
religious feuds and wars; third, wonderful political
disturbances; fourth, temporal or physical disasters.&nbsp; Of
the social condition of these last days, Paul instructs us:
&ldquo;This know, also, that in the last days perilous times
shall come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he groups together nineteen immoral
attributes of the social state of these last days: &ldquo;Men
shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud
blasphemers, disobedient (to parents especially), unthankful,
unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false
accusers, incontinent, fierce despisers, traitors, heady,
high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than God, formal in
religion&rdquo; (2 Timothy iii.).&nbsp; What, we ask, will be the
state of society when the social condition becomes such?</p>
<p>The religious feuds and persecutions of the last days we can
but faintly conceive.&nbsp; It was terrible when the beast, two
hundred years ago, held sway.&nbsp; The Inquisition, the rack,
the stake, and all the horrors of a wise age will be brought to
bear.&nbsp; For in these days to come, the beast will be joined
by Anti-Christ, <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>who will burn with rage, and vent
his displeasure on Christ&rsquo;s followers.&nbsp; Also the
barbarism and savage disposition of the Pagans will be let
loose.&nbsp; Then will the dragon tear and destroy.&nbsp; This
will, indeed, be a day or time of visitation.&nbsp; The political
disturbances will be terrible.&nbsp; Nation against nation
plotting and deceiving; internal strife and outward
dangers.&nbsp; These are of a kind to appal one in reading
them.&nbsp; Then come the temporal or physical evils.&nbsp; These
are to be a horrible train of ills in the form of pestilence,
famine, and earthquakes.&nbsp; The plague of yellow fever is as
nought to some of the scourges that will then go forth.&nbsp;
Gibbon, the historian, tells of a plague that swept away
two-thirds of Europe and Asia.&nbsp; At that time the dead lay
unburied by thousands.&nbsp; In Constantinople, for three months,
five and even ten thousand persons died daily.&nbsp; The famines
in India and China give us some idea of those yet to come.&nbsp;
Of the earthquakes, such as have been will be repeated in
increasing terror, violence, and destruction.&nbsp; To all these
shall be added fire from heaven, hail, whirlwinds, and
floods.&nbsp; These are times that will try men&rsquo;s
souls.&nbsp; Read the prophets for yourselves, and range
yourselves on the Lord&rsquo;s side.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And His feet shall stand in that day upon
the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the East: and
the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the
East and toward the West, and there shall be a very great valley;
and half the mountain shall remove toward the North, and half of
it toward the South.&rdquo;&mdash;Zech. xiv. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some four thousand years ago the earth was washed with the
regenerating waters of a terrible flood.&nbsp; Millions were
suddenly cut off, with their handiwork and antediluvian
civilisation.&nbsp; The swelling floods subsided, and the
God-avenging waters retired to their appointed place.&nbsp; The
earth again stood forth in virgin strength, lonely, bare, and
citiless, but with a potency and promise inviting and
grand.&nbsp; Across these swelling floods one craft had been
safely borne; in it was stored the seed-stock of a new world of
man and beast.&nbsp; The destruction had been complete and
terrible.&nbsp; If we credit Dr. Gurney and others who have
written on this subject, the population far exceeded the
inhabitants of to-day.&nbsp; But whether they did or did not, we
know that many must have perished, and civilisation must have
been hurled back to a primitive beginning.&nbsp; No doubt the
present seas and oceans cover over the ruins of that age.&nbsp;
Eliphaz, the Temanite, when addressing Job, said: &ldquo;Hast
thou marked the old way, which wicked men have trodden, which
were cut down out of time? <i>whose foundation was overflown with
a flood</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now is it not reasonable to <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>suppose that in this and every other great change in
nature God has a purpose&mdash;a design agreeable with His own
exalted character?&nbsp; He is too wise to err, and too good to
be unkind.&nbsp; The flood came for the same reason that He only
gave Adam one wife.&nbsp; And what was that reason?&nbsp; It was
that He might fill the world with a godly seed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
did not He make one?&nbsp; Yet had He the residue of the
Spirit.&nbsp; And wherefore one?&nbsp; That He might seek a godly
seed&rdquo; (Mal. ii. 15).&nbsp; The same Spirit which made one
Eve could have made twenty, for the residue of the Spirit was
with Him.&nbsp; It was in the interest of morality and godliness
that the flood came.</p>
<p>When this design began to fail of being accomplished by the
increased wickedness of the post-diluvians, then God called
Abram, and through Abraham and his seed designed that this
purpose should flow on and be fulfilled.&nbsp; Through this
Abrahamic channel flow all the purposes of a Divine Providence in
this world.&nbsp; Through his seed all the nations of the earth
are to be blessed.&nbsp; The children of Abraham are the
appointed and Divinely authorised agents of God.&nbsp; Through
them, as primary, he has, and is, and will evangelise the
world.&nbsp; Abraham stands to the generations of earth as the
Gulf-stream to Europe and the isles of the sea.&nbsp; This
Gulf-stream is our largest river; being the longest, broadest,
and deepest.&nbsp; Its bottom and banks are cold water.&nbsp;
Compressed by the straits of Florida, it rushes forth to warm and
replenish the earth and isles of the sea.&nbsp; So the forces of
a Divine Providence compressed in Abraham go forth to bless
mankind.&nbsp; The Gulf-stream is water in water, and
Abraham&rsquo;s seed are men among men.&nbsp; Providence is at
once clear and intelligible, and history is at once plain,
reasonable, and harmonious, when interpreted in harmony with the
Abrahamic covenant.&nbsp; The scattering and returning of Israel
and Judah to Palestine, and the intervening history, from the
time of dispersion to the Return, is clear as noon-day.&nbsp;
Their location, oppression, prosperity, <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>and
victories, have long been foretold by prophets inspired of
God.</p>
<p>Through all the changes in nature God has a design.&nbsp; He
prepared the world for Adam and his seed, and He did so by some
wonderful upheaving and overturning; this scientists will
admit.&nbsp; This world, in its present shape and condition,
indicates fierce and protracted struggles.&nbsp; The outlines of
strange and sublime revolutions are imprinted on her rock-ribbed
bosom.&nbsp; Look at her cloud-capped mountains, her snow-crowned
peaks, her wild and rocky wastes, her barren plains and sandy
deserts, her fruitful hills and luxuriant valleys, her mighty
oceans and swelling seas, her inland lakes and rolling rivers;
these tell us of a time long ago&mdash;of the time when the
Mighty One went forth to work a work, to build a house and make a
home for His creature, man.&nbsp; And as it was necessary in the
preparatory stage to tune nature to the coming man, so all along
through the history of the centuries we find nature holding a
subordinate relation to man.&nbsp; The world is not run on one
principle and man on another, but both are permeated by a Divine
force and led on to a Divine end.&nbsp; All things are ours, and
we are Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is God&rsquo;s; this is the
established order of subordination.&nbsp; Most certainly it
cannot be unscientific in the Author of nature to make the same
His messenger for good or evil.&nbsp; It is not unscientific to
throw a line from the shore to a ship in distress, even though
thrown from the mouth of a cannon, nor is it counted unscientific
to use that same cannon in war to destroy men.</p>
<p>The earthquake spoken of in the text is, indeed, a small
affair in comparison to some that have occurred in this world;
and if the same God be living now as then, surely He can rend in
twain the little mountain of Olivet.&nbsp; And if we grant to the
infidel scientist of to-day the fact that there is no God, still
the thing prophesied of is neither unreasonable or impossible,
<!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>because what has been may be again; and as the demand
in this case is small in comparison to what has been, surely this
thing may come to pass.&nbsp; In times past Providence and the
wants of the Church have been timely aided by convulsions in
nature, and if they were only so accidentally, why then
accidentally they may all agree again.&nbsp; To the scientist,
especially the geologist, there can be no great difficulty in
crediting the miracles of the text when we think of the
successive revolutions that have taken place.&nbsp; Fires, and
floods, and earthquakes, have done sublime service in the past,
whether we credit the same to Nature or to God.&nbsp; That an
earthquake, or any peculiar expression of nature, should be timed
to meet a special condition of the Church or the special purposes
of a Providence, is not strange.&nbsp; In such an event there
really is no more wonder than that a man should set an alarm on
his clock to go off at three minutes past four in the
morning.&nbsp; Some men can swallow big things if you will only
allow them to make out the author to be Nature.&nbsp; But whether
we attribute the things past to Nature or to God, we know that
wonderful things have happened.</p>
<p>Seismology, the science of earthquakes, is by no means void of
interest.&nbsp; The earthquake catalogue of the British
Association takes notice of, and records the occurrence of, over
6,000 that happened between 1606 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
and 1842 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; Some of these have
been terrible in force, destruction, and extent, oftentimes
changing the whole face of a country, its climate, and river
courses.&nbsp; The great earthquake of 1783 in Calabria, probably
caused the death of 100,000 people; it was felt over a great part
of Europe.&nbsp; The city of Lisbon was visited on the morning of
November 1st, 1755, with an earthquake so severe that in a few
minutes 60,000 persons perished, and most of the city was
destroyed and buried beneath the water of the bay some 600
feet.</p>
<p>The country given to Abraham embraces all of what we call <!--
page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Syria.&nbsp; It is central, and specially adapted for
the future purposes of God through Abraham&rsquo;s seed.&nbsp;
Beginning with the North-west corner, the boundaries will be
Mount Taurus, river Euphrates, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Red
Sea, River Nile, and Mediterranean, enclosing Syria, Arabia
Deserts, Arabia Felix and Arabia Petr&oelig;a.&nbsp; Thus it will
be seen that the Abrahamic inheritance is surrounded by water,
except at two points&mdash;namely, the North-west land boundary,
which is between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean Sea.&nbsp;
The entrance is through the mountain range of Taurus, and forms a
natural gate or mountain pass from Europe and Asia into
Palestine.&nbsp; Here, when the Tribes are resettled in the land
of Palestine, this gate will be in the allotment of Dan.&nbsp;
Our Irish brethren will again be in the North-west, where they
will have to fight and defend the land and the truth, as in days
of old, for their brethren.&nbsp; The fact is, &ldquo;Dan shall
judge his people as one of the Tribes of Israel,&rdquo; said old
Jacob.&nbsp; The judge in olden times sat in the gate.&nbsp; So
will Dan sit.&nbsp; Moses said that Dan was a lion&rsquo;s
whelp.&nbsp; Among Israel it is customary to put lions as guards
at gateways.&nbsp; The Southwest corner, between the
Mediterranean and the Sea of Suez, forms the other land
boundary.&nbsp; Through this gate will come the teeming millions
of Africa.&nbsp; At this gate will be the Tribe of Gad&mdash;that
is, a portion of the Scotch, the lowlanders.&nbsp; The Tribes
will be hemmed in one by another so that they cannot enlarge
their territory; but Gad can, for a vast country opens up beyond
the gate.&nbsp; It is barren; still the desert is to blossom as a
rose.&nbsp; Of Gad it was said by Moses, &ldquo;Blessed be He
that enlargeth Gad; he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm
with the crown of the head.&nbsp; And he provided the first part
for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he
seated.&rdquo;&nbsp; You remember that Sinai is in this
portion.&nbsp; What sight and foresight Jacob and Moses
had!&nbsp; The land as thus bounded would be 600 miles broad from
the Red Sea to the River <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Euphrates,
and 1,390 between the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and from the
Mediterranean to the Arabian Sea, 1,600.&nbsp; These boundaries
you will glean by taking note of the several promises to Abraham
and his seed, as recorded in Gen. xv. 10, and Exod. xxiii. 31,
and Deut. xi. 24.&nbsp; The land so promised and given specially
to Abraham and his seed, the descendants of Abraham never yet
occupied, no, not half of it, even in the palmy days of King
Solomon.&nbsp; Will it ever be?&nbsp; We answer, Yes, as sure as
the seasons and night and day.&nbsp; He is faithful that has
promised, and will do it.</p>
<p>This remarkable peninsula will be the theatre of the future
glory of Israel and Judah.&nbsp; As finely described by the Rev.
A. B. Grimaldi, it will be found to be most exactly and suitably
placed to enable them to fulfil their high destiny to all
nations, and become the centre of all lands, the praise and
beauty of the whole earth.&nbsp; This land has, in fact, a
central position for communication, commerce, and all other
advantages of civilisation not enjoyed by any other portion of
land in the whole world; while the peculiar geographical
formation is such that it has an immense seaboard, and is
therefore fitted for vaster commercial and naval operations than
have ever yet been seen, commanding, as it does, the three most
important seas and the two largest rivers of the whole world.</p>
<p>This land, as laid out by Ezekiel, will be divided into
thirteen longitudinal strips, sixty miles long, and twenty
broad.&nbsp; In the very centre will be a portion, some fifty
miles square, which will be divided and apportioned to what is
called the holy oblation&mdash;namely, in the very middle will be
the temple, a mile square, or larger than ever the whole city of
Jerusalem has yet been.&nbsp; Then the city will be ten miles
square.&nbsp; On one side will be a portion for the priests; on
another, a portion for the Levites; and on the other two sides,
the prince&rsquo;s or king&rsquo;s portion.&nbsp; This portion,

will not be supported by taxes.&nbsp; He will have to judge the
land.&nbsp; He cannot take any more land.&nbsp; He will have to
support his own family.&nbsp; No public grant to his
children.&nbsp; He will have to be liberal with the temple.&nbsp;
He will have sixty miles of sea coast to defend and sixty miles
of land frontier to protect, and thus cover some of the weaker
tribes.&nbsp; The city will have 720 square miles as a suburb, in
which to raise supplies specially for itself.&nbsp; It will in
reality be in two parts&mdash;one called by the prophets the
profane; here will the commercial business be done.&nbsp; The
other part will be sacred.&nbsp; Into it strangers will not
enter; it will be holy&mdash;a quiet habitation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad
rivers and streams, wherein shall go no gaily with oars, neither
shall gallant ships pass thereby.&rdquo;&nbsp; The city proper
will be some thirty miles North of the present city of
Jerusalem.</p>

COMING&mdash;EVOLUTION AND DEVOLUTION.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to
the thousand three hundred and five and thirty
days.&rdquo;&mdash;Daniel xii. 12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So according to the prophet Daniel there is a time to come in
which it will be blessed to live.&nbsp; The prophecies of Daniel
are generally of a material character&mdash;that is, they have
special reference to this world politically, and to this end he
had direct and special reference to certain kingdoms in existence
at the time of writing, as well as others that were to come into
being.&nbsp; Of all the prophets he concerns himself the most
with positive data of the rise and fall of nations.&nbsp; The
figures of the data used, we freely confess, are difficult to
understand and interpret.&nbsp; The Church and times are greatly
in need of some man competent on this point.&nbsp; All prophetic
students know the diversity and confusion in this department of
theology.&nbsp; Of all the difficult departments of theology none
exceed the numerical.&nbsp; The numerical symbolism of the Bible
is as yet but little understood.&nbsp; True, indeed, we are
improving.&nbsp; Aided by Providence, we are enabled to interpret
some dates by data&mdash;that is, certain events occurring locate
us and point out the prophetic period we are in.&nbsp; Like the
captain who is unable by his certain and usual modes of
calculating to find his whereabouts, does so by currents, the
Gulf-stream, islands, colour of waters, &amp;c., did we know the
exact quantity of Daniel&rsquo;s two thousand and three hundred
days, his times, time, and half <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>a time, his
seventy weeks, his thousand two hundred and ninety days, and the
thousand three hundred and five and thirty days, then we could
deal with the prophecies with a definitiveness to which as yet we
are strangers.</p>
<p>The times, however, are peculiarly interesting from the very
fact that the Church is waking up to the importance of prophetic
study.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coming events cast their shadows
before,&rdquo; is a trite but true saying, and here as true as
anywhere.&nbsp; Men feel in their fears and hopes the pressure of
prophecy.&nbsp; The Church is remarkably anxious and
unrest.&nbsp; Governments are suspicious and confused.&nbsp; The
populace are restless and threatening.&nbsp; Indeed, everything
conspires in Church, State, and people, to forecast the
future.&nbsp; A thunderstorm is felt before it is seen or
heard.&nbsp; It shadows the mind, thrills the nerves, and pains
the rheumatic limbs.&nbsp; Many in 1858 felt war coming in our
own country.&nbsp; Many were at a loss to interpret their
fears.&nbsp; Some, however, interpreted the signs of the time and
sounded an alarm.</p>
<p>The few years to come are pregnant with angry forces.&nbsp;
Men are busy in Russia, Germany, France, England, and America,
sowing the winds, and the harvest will surely be
whirlwinds.&nbsp; But, beyond all, the sky is clear.&nbsp; War
ceases, commerce revives, the nations accept a settled peace,
science and religion join hand in hand to prepare the wastes and
woes of war.&nbsp; The beast is overcome, Anti-Christ is slain,
and the dragon is banished from the earth.&nbsp; Jerusalem again
rises in splendour from the grave of desolation.&nbsp; Again
Canaan will become the glory of all lands, and Jerusalem the
glory of Canaan.&nbsp; Here, again, after centuries of wandering,
shall the throne of David find rest, and on it one of
David&rsquo;s seed, chosen and anointed of God, accepted of men,
and served by the nations.&nbsp; Crowned and imperial Salem shall
become the home of her long-captive sons and daughters.&nbsp;
Israel and Judah shall meet together, and shall be one stick, one
people, having one head, one throne, one city, one Lord, even
Jesus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore, they shall come and <!-- page
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to
the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil,
and for the young of the flock and of the herd; and their soul
shall be as a watered garden, and they shall not sorrow any more
at all&rdquo; (Jeremiah xxxi. 12).</p>
<p>No one can read the prophecies that find their fulfilment
after the battle of Armageddon&mdash;or, as the prophets have it,
&ldquo;after those days&rdquo;&mdash;without being ravished with
delight.&nbsp; Israel in her palmy days, and Judah in her
glory!&nbsp; A nation called of God, and ruled by God through
David or Solomon; how inviting!&nbsp; When Heaven was their
Defence and Provider; when the fidelity of men to God was enough
of defence, and the morality of a people was a rich manure giving
an abundant harvest in field, stall, and orchard; then we see the
true position of a nation, its grandeur and prosperity.&nbsp; I
am convinced that morality has a more intimate relation with the
forces and wealth of nature than we are in the habit of
believing.&nbsp; God can give increased measure to the harvest,
fruitfulness to the vine, plenty in the orchard, increase in the
stall, and addition to the household.&nbsp; Time upon time are
these blessings promised by the prophets to Israel and Judah in
the latter day.</p>
<p>Take notice of a few statements of the prophets responding to
those times&mdash;the times that will ensue after the Ten Lost
Tribes of Israel and the Jews are again possessed of, and settled
in, Palestine.&nbsp; Jeremiah, in the 30th chapter and 31st,
refers to those times: &ldquo;For lo, the days come, saith the
Lord, that I will bring again the captivity of My people, Israel
and Judah, saith the Lord; and I will cause them to return to the
land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess
it&rdquo;&mdash;referring to this time and the battle of
Armageddon, in which Israel will be tested as we have before
shown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas! for that day is great, so that none is
like it; it is even the time of Jacob&rsquo;s trouble; but he
shall be saved out of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, we ask, <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>why will it be specially a time of trouble?&nbsp; We
answer, Because of the strength of the combined forces that will
be arrayed against Israel&mdash;that is, England.&nbsp; The
forces, as set forth in the Scriptures, are <i>thirteen on one
side</i>, <i>led by Russia</i>, and <i>four on the other</i>,
which will be <i>led by England</i>.&nbsp; The <i>thirteen</i>
are: 1st, Gog; 2nd, Magog; 3rd, Rosh; 4th, Meshech; 5th, Tubal;
6th, Persia; 7th, Ethiopia; 8th, Libya; 9th, Gomer; 10th,
Togarmah; 11th, the Beast; 12th, the Dragon; and 13th,
Anti-Christ.&nbsp; The <i>four</i> are: 1st, Sheba; 2nd, Dedan;
3rd, Merchants of Tarshish with all their young lions; 4th, the
Jews and Israelites settled in Palestine, that will not be led
astray by Anti-Christ.</p>
<p>To understand the prophets when forecasting the future, we
must keep in mind that in speaking of a nation&rsquo;s destiny in
the future, they would speak of it by the name it had at that
time, if such a nation had an existence at that time.&nbsp; But
in course of time, such nations would change their name, and
sometimes locality; in such a case they must be found.&nbsp; For
instance, if one desires to know the destiny of Turkey, he will
find it set forth by the prophets under the name of Edom and
Esau.&nbsp; Moab and Ammon are found in the Poles and Hungarians;
they were the sons of Lot.&nbsp; In all parts of the world the
children of Abraham have an attachment for each other.&nbsp; Thus
India was peopled at first by the descendants of Abraham; hence
they will mix with, and accept English rule sooner than any other
people.&nbsp; &ldquo;But unto the sons of the concubines which
Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac
his son, while he yet lived, Eastward, unto the East
country&rdquo; (Gen. xxv. 6).&nbsp; If we trace back the origin
of a people to their head or founder, we will better understand
their peculiarities and national idiosyncrasies.&nbsp; Study
Ishmael to understand the Arabs, Esau to understand the Turks,
Ammon and Moab to understand the Poles and Hungarians.&nbsp;
Study the character and condition of Manasseh in Egypt, as <!--
page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>being brought up in a palace, and being the lawful
heir, but deprived of his birthright by a Providence which he
could not understand, and you have at once a key to the Pilgrim
character, and the characteristics of a real American&mdash;why
he hates titles, kings, and aristocracies.&nbsp; But he forgets
not the place of his youth when he had the great seal made; for
on the reverse of the great seal of the United States you will
have the figure of a Pyramid crowned with the All-seeing
eye.&nbsp; No Tribe but the Tribe of Manasseh could say, or did
say, &ldquo;We are a great people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet so this Tribe
said to Joshua (see Josh. xvii.).&nbsp; So we often say,
&ldquo;We are a great people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel and Leah, the two wives of Jacob, are the real source
of the separation of the Ten Tribes of Israel from Judah.&nbsp;
Each wife sought to have her son as a leader.&nbsp; Thus between
Judah and Joseph began the spirit of rivalry.&nbsp; Ephraim took
up the cause of Rachel.&nbsp; David and Saul&rsquo;s bitterness
lies here.&nbsp; David stood for Leah, and Saul for Rachel.&nbsp;
The descendants of the North of Ireland, being from the Tribe of
Dan, have ever been distinct from the rest of the Irish in
features, enterprise, spirit and religion; for the others are the
Canaanites of old, the Philistines.</p>
<p>Who do the thirteen enemies stand for to-day?&nbsp; Let me
answer you briefly.&nbsp; Gog stands for the Caucasians or
mountain tribes of Caucasus.&nbsp; Magog covers the inhabitants
and country North of the Caucasian mountains, and they are known
as Tartars.&nbsp; Rosh, or Roosh, means the real Russians.&nbsp;
Their ruler is called by the Prophet Ezekiel <i>Nasi
Roosh</i>.&nbsp; We translate it the chief prince of
Meshech.&nbsp; This portion, or people of Russia, are the old
Babylonians, hence the hate and rivalry between England and that
nation.&nbsp; Meshech means the Muscovites, who made Moscow what
it is.&nbsp; Tubal is found in the Siberians.&nbsp; Meshech and
Tubal are generally mentioned together in the Scriptures, and,
strange to say, they are found together in history to-day.&nbsp;
Moscow is the capital of Meshech, <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>for though
to the world St. Petersburgh seems to be, yet every imperial
document is signed and dated Moscow.&nbsp; Tobolski is the
capital of Tubal or Siberia.&nbsp; Persia still retains its
ancient name, and will be easily recognised.&nbsp; Also the same
with Ethiopia.&nbsp; Libya takes in a portion of the African
race.&nbsp; Gomer stands for the Germans in part, for those who
descended from Gomer.&nbsp; From this word Gomer is Gomeron,
Gemren, and the country Germia, hence, Germany and Germans.&nbsp;
Togarmah includes the people of Independent Tartary.&nbsp; The
Dragon includes China.&nbsp; The Beast, the Jesuits and their
followers, which will take in France, Spain, Italy, and South
America; and at first divide even England, especially Ireland,
and the United States.&nbsp; Anti-Christ will be chiefly
sustained by the Jews, who will have been settled in
Palestine.</p>
<p>The four opposing forces led by England: Sheba represents
India, who is already training for this time of battle.&nbsp;
Dedan embraces Arabia, especially that part occupied by the
Sultan of Muscat.&nbsp; Merchants of Tarshish and all the young
lions, means England and her colonies, in which is embraced the
United States.&nbsp; Manasseh will have to stretch out a helping
hand to Jacob in the time of his trouble, for she cannot allow
liberty to be enslaved, and freedom of worship and conscience to
be trampled under foot.&nbsp; The plague will come here sooner
than we think, by a civil and internal division among ourselves,
which will force us to take part.&nbsp; The Jews that are not
carried away with Anti-Christ will join with their brethren of
Israel.&nbsp; The called, the chosen, and the faithful, will be
one party, and they will be on the Lord&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>If during the late Turkish war we could have had our
despatches agreeable to ancient names of people and country, they
would have sounded queer.&nbsp; Instead of reading of the
Russians passing the Caucasus, and moving upon Erzeroum by way of
Kars, we should have read: Rapid advance of the Babylonians under
the chief prince of Meshech.&nbsp; Successful <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>passage of
the Pison.&nbsp; The whole land of Havilah occupied.&nbsp; The
men of Togarmah rally at Gihon.&nbsp; Fierce fighting in
Eden.&nbsp; The invaders defeated in the mountains of
Ararat.&nbsp; For according to ancient names of people and
country, such was the fact.&nbsp; It is comforting to all
God&rsquo;s people to know from His Word that there is a time of
peace; that there is a golden age in the near future.&nbsp; Dr.
McKay has the Christian idea in his poem:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a good time coming, boys,<br />
Wait a little longer;<br />
Let us aid it all we can,<br />
Every woman, every man,<br />
The good time coming.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When will the 1,335 days of years, spoken of in the text,
end?&nbsp; We answer, About the year 1957.&nbsp; And why that
year?&nbsp; Because these days evidently date there, beginning
from the time the daily sacrifice is taken away and the city
trodden under foot.&nbsp; The little goat horn of Daniel viii. 9
stands, we have before shown you, for Turkey.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
exceeding great toward the South, and toward the East, and toward
the pleasant land.&rdquo;&nbsp; It stands for Mahommedanism,
which was to overturn Christianity for a given period, a time,
times, and a half time, or in figures, 1260.&nbsp; Now Mahommed
was accepted and crowned at Mecca in the year 622.&nbsp; If we
add 1260 and 622, we have 1882&mdash;a time that is very plainly
pointed out in the Pyramid.&nbsp; Daniel says, &ldquo;Seventy
weeks are determined upon Thy people and upon Thy holy
city,&rdquo; Jerusalem.&nbsp; These weeks put into prophetic
years make 490, which, of course, brings us to the time when
Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus.&nbsp; Daniel asked how long the
vision concerning the daily sacrifice and transgression of
desolation to give the sanctuary and people to be trodden
down?&nbsp; The answer was, Unto 2,300 days, taking a day for a
year.&nbsp; Jerusalem was destroyed in the year 70.&nbsp; Take
this from 490 <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>and we have 420.&nbsp; Now these 420
years taken from 2,300 will bring 1880.&nbsp; Then the sanctuary
is to be cleansed&mdash;that is, Jerusalem will be in the
possession of England.&nbsp; She now is.</p>
<p>From about 1880, or 1882, England will possess
Jerusalem.&nbsp; In the twelfth chapter of Daniel, eleventh
verse, we find thirty days added to the 1,200, making 1,290;
these added thirty years denote the time England will have to
contend for her right to Palestine.&nbsp; It will finally be
acknowledged, however, by all nations.&nbsp; In 1935 the battle
of Armageddon will end, but Palestine will not be fully settled
down to a peaceful possession till 1957.&nbsp; Then the
government will be fully established and acknowledged all over
the world.&nbsp; The kings and Gentile nations will have gone up
to Jerusalem and given in their adherence.&nbsp; Then all the
world will be federated to David&rsquo;s throne.&nbsp; The year
1957 I arrive at by the same rule as the other&mdash;1,335 when
added to 622, makes 1,957.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed,&rdquo; says
Daniel, &ldquo;are they who see that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world is to undergo some marvellous changes these next few
years&mdash;mechanically, politically, socially, and morally; the
telephone, the phonograph, the microphone, the telemachole and
coming improvements will transform our modes of labour and
learning beyond our present conception.&nbsp; God times
inventions and improvements to the advancement of His
kingdom.</p>
<p>I do not regard inventions as mere accidents, but as the
outcoming of a Divine intent through human agencies.&nbsp; Watts
and Wesley both did good service for the Church and the
world.&nbsp; Edison and others of kindred minds are scientific
prophets.&nbsp; &ldquo;The earth is the Lord&rsquo;s and the
fulness thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; All is made subservient to the
progress of the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; The doctrine of the
evolution of man as taught by Darwin is neither complimentary to
man or God; but the doctrine of devolution is.&nbsp; Man is a
developing creature; a creature who takes centuries to grow
in.&nbsp; The devolution of God is through man by means of all
the increasing facilities <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>and
agencies that make man stronger, wiser, and better.&nbsp; The
secret powers and forces of nature are revealed to man in the
ratio of his ability to apply them, on the same scale as we
instruct our children.</p>
<p>In the latter days, or the period spoken of by Daniel, nature
will be Divinely prompted with an impulse of generosity not now
known, for then men will be wise enough, strong enough, and good
enough, to use the same and not abuse.&nbsp; The prophetic
teachings glow with promises of regaling plenty, peace and good
will in those days.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will multiply upon you man and
beasts; and they shall increase and bring fruit; and I will
settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you
than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I am the
Lord&rdquo; (Ezek. xxxvi. 11).&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;I will
multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field,
that ye receive no more reproach of famine, among the
heathen.&rdquo;&nbsp; I submit and believe that all this God will
do by what men are pleased to call natural law.&nbsp; The Divine
will not rudely break in upon His own established laws.</p>
<p>Sin impairs the energy and growth of man, and so infringes
upon Nature.&nbsp; As man frees himself from the bondage and
sequences of sin, he will rise higher and higher in his command
and authority over Nature&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp; Three several
times the earth has been cursed, which curse is gradually removed
as man returns unto his God in loving and obedient service.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened
her mouth to receive thy brother&rsquo;s blood from thy
hand.&nbsp; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth
yield unto thee her strength&rdquo; (Gen. iv. 11).&nbsp; The
secret of a world&rsquo;s wealth and peace lies here, and it were
well if reformers and agitators understood this.&nbsp; For they
work best who work in harmony with God and His laws.</p>

THE EARTH&mdash;THE HISTORY OF MAN CONTAINED IN IT, PAST AND
FUTURE&mdash;SCIENCE AND THE BIBLE, ETC., ETC.</p>
<p>The wonderful discourses of the Rev. Dr. Wild, of Brooklyn,
were continued last Sunday evening, before a thronged
congregation in Elm Place Church.&nbsp; Under the organ gallery,
behind the pulpit, was a representation of the Pyramid, or as the
learned doctor terms it, &ldquo;the stone Bible,&rdquo; its
massive rectangular dark stone foundation and some of the most
interesting of its interior passages, chambers, and
mysteries.&nbsp; All eyes were fastened in scrutiny upon it, well
knowing that some revelation of unusual Christian interest would
be made by the Doctor from it as soon as his lecture
commenced.&nbsp; The preliminary exercises of singing <!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>by
a well-trained choir and prayer were therefore impatiently
listened to by many whose thoughts were concentrated on the
wonders of the Pyramid and its astounding confirmation of the
prophetic Scriptures.&nbsp; Dr. Wild read a lesson from Job
xxxviii., remarking that the author of that book was also the
engineering director or architectural author of the Pyramid and
identical with Shem and Melchisedec.&nbsp; The book of Job is the
oldest book in the world by 200 or 300 years.&nbsp; Shem, or Job,
was ninety-eight years old when he entered the ark, and he lived
thirty years after Abraham, with whom therefore he shook hands,
as well as with Methuselah, who shook hands with Adam.&nbsp; Only
one man, therefore, stood between Adam and Shem, and only two, or
not quite two, between Adam and Abraham.&nbsp; The book of
Berosus, of Babylon, is the only one that compares with Job in
antiquity.&nbsp; This was the age of tradition before Moses
compiled the first portions of it.&nbsp; In the days of Abraham,
Shem was the patriarch, or oldest, of his family; and it was
therefore to him he did homage, according to the patriarchal
custom, under the name of Melchisedec, when returning from the
slaughter of the kings.&nbsp; Shem had brought with him from the
days before the flood much of the knowledge and wisdom which had
been accumulated in the earth during the 2,000 years previous to
that event, and which was swept away when only eight persons were
saved in the ark.&nbsp; We have been told that the human race has
gradually improved, and that our ancestors in far off ages were
monkeys, or something of that sort, but the remains of the ruins
and knowledge of antiquity show everything the reverse of this to
be the truth.&nbsp; Look at that Pyramid.&nbsp; We could not
build it to-day, with all our boasted science.&nbsp; It will bear
in every respect the closest scientific scrutiny.&nbsp; Our
greatest scientists are only beginning to comprehend the depths
of its mysteries, yet it is over 4,000 years old.&nbsp; The
capstone on top of it is a Pyramid in itself, in miniature,
unlike anything of the kind or any other building on the
earth.&nbsp; The <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>reverend gentleman then continued to
read from Job xxxviii., and shew that the writer of it was master
of astronomical and geographical science and the builder of the
Pyramid, which is a miniature of the measurement of the earth and
indicates the history of the human race.&nbsp; After this
preliminary dissertation he took for his text Isaiah xxviii. 29:
&ldquo;This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is
wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible is a growing book, being more read and better
understood as the years pass by; and as men shall increase in
knowledge and power, so the Bible will gain in influence and
authority.&nbsp; Opposition to its teaching, and vaunting denial
of its authority, shall be made subservient to its interests by
goading on the Church to a wiser and more noble defence and
exposition of the same.&nbsp; No theology can levy upon the
well-defined facts of science in confirmation of the sublime
teachings of inspiration.&nbsp; The Christian student need not
hold himself in timid dread for fear the scientist will discover
aught in the realms of nature that will contradict the Word of
God: for as sure as God is the Author of both, so surely shall we
find an agreement between revelation and science at every point
truly understood&mdash;increased light means increased
evidence.&nbsp; Nations and men, nature and Providence, are
united witnesses for God, and the Scriptures, and the more we
know of the past, the better shall we understand the present and
forecast the future.&nbsp; Let us recognise the future.&nbsp; Let
us recognise the important difference between the Bible
subjectively and objectively&mdash;that is, between what the
Bible really is and what men think it is.&nbsp; Let us be free
enough, bold enough, and wise enough, to claim the Bible
itself.&nbsp; Let us unyoke it from tradition, which claims to be
superior, or even equal.&nbsp; Let us divorce it from councils,
from creeds, from sects and denominations; let us lift it up out
of the ecclesiastical rut of ages.&nbsp; Let us with a
commendable pride count ourselves <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>worthy and
able to formulate our own creeds, make our own prayers and
confessions, accounting that the liberties of our fathers have
been bequeathed to their children, and that the same God who gave
them liberty and power is no less gracious to us, their
offsprings.&nbsp; Traditions, councils, creeds, and degrees are
worth much unto us as aids to a higher life, and a nobler
civilisation.&nbsp; The Christian fathers, the Luthers, Calvins,
Knoxes, Wesleys, and others, were our servants, as we will be the
servants of coming generations.&nbsp; They worked grandly, they
wrought well, they procured for us a goodly heritage; to them we
are indebted.&nbsp; Yet it was not their purpose nor the design
of Providence to enslave us, or to stereotype the Church for the
ages to come.&nbsp; Increased light is increased evidence,
enabling us the better to understand the Word of God.&nbsp; When
a publisher has stereotyped a book, he is naturally loath to make
any change or correction; so Churches who have stereotyped the
Bible are very unwilling to change, to receive light.&nbsp;
Hence, they are sometimes found opposing the march of a better
civilisation, proving and sustaining all manner of institutions
and tyrannies: the torturing and terrible Inquisition of Spain,
the punishment and hanging of supposed witches by England and New
England, the bondage and slavery of the South.&nbsp; So, to prove
their creeds and systems correct, they each have a mode of their
own, Catholic, Episcopalian, Baptist, Congregational, Methodist,
&amp;c.&nbsp; <i>So also</i>, theologians have often been
impatient to reconcile the Scriptures with history, even to
suggest mistakes in the sacred record.&nbsp; Instance Daniel
being made the <span class="smcap">Third Ruler</span>.&nbsp;
<i>They supposed it meant second</i>, but later researches show
that Babylon had two rulers at that time&mdash;namely,
Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar&mdash;so Daniel was made a
third.&nbsp; See the remains of Borsippia, near Babylon (Dan. v.
29).&nbsp; Now we know that both Daniel and Berosus, the old
Babylonian historians, were right, and the Bible was right in
using the word third.&nbsp; God in His revelation has always been
equal to man&rsquo;s need.&nbsp; Tradition&mdash;Abraham <!--
page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>saw Shem, for Shem lived some thirty years after
Abraham&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Shem, and Melchisedek, and Job, are
likely the same person.&nbsp; Certainly, Shem and Melchisedek are
the same, and by Egyptian historians called Philitis.&nbsp; This
Philitis was the builder of the Great Pyramid.&nbsp; Now Shem saw
Methuselah and Methuselah Adam.&nbsp; Thus, then, tradition would
be sufficient.&nbsp; As tradition failed, the written Word
began.&nbsp; There is little doubt now but that <i>Shem</i>,
called also Melchisedek, was the builder of the Pyramid, being
instructed of God, as his father Noah had been in building the
ark, and as Moses with the tabernacle, and Solomon with the
temple, as the prophet in the text and context shows that the
wisdom of the man is often the gift of God.&nbsp; <i>See Moses
also</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
See, I have called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of
Hur, of the Tribe of Judah; and I have filled him with the Spirit
of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in
all manner of workmanship: to devise cunning works, to work in
gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to
set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of
workmanship.&nbsp; And, behold, I have given him Aholiab, the son
of Ahisamach, of the Tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that
are wise-hearted I have put wisdom that they may make all that I
have commanded thee&rdquo; (Exodus xxxi. 1&ndash;6).</p>
<p>Let us look at this building, for it is a special revelation
for these times.&nbsp; For this precise and scientific day God
has provided.&nbsp; Science and the Bible are interlocked in this
building; they agree, they testify for the same God, yet they
witness to the same Christ, the Providence and history of His
chosen people.&nbsp; This stone book could not be read till now;
it even takes the most precise scientific men of the day to read
it.&nbsp; For thousands of years there has been no one in the
court of the world able to question and interpret this witness of
the Lord in Egypt.&nbsp; The scientists have been asking for some
<!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>other revelation than the Bible, for the supernatural
in a scientific form, for something beyond man, for something all
could see, for something that would answer to pure science, for
something that could be seen, handled, measured, tested, and
amenable to mathematics; something superhuman, for something in
which the human and the Divine blend.&nbsp; Thank Heaven, all
they ask is granted in this stone monument.&nbsp; Here we have
science forecast for thousands of years; here we have the
grandest of problems in science solved, and the sublimest
phenomena of religion and science crystalised, symbolising and
teaching the most marvellous facts in religion, sociology, and
astronomy.&nbsp; It is not a tomb, nor granary, nor temple, but a
pillar and witness unto the Lord of hosts.&nbsp; Think of a few
facts.&nbsp; 1. Its location, the centre of the land surface of
the whole earth.&nbsp; Hence the best zero point on earth for
meridianal and latitudinal calculations.&nbsp; Central to
clime&mdash;here is no rust, moss, nor frosts to destroy, nor
earthquake&mdash;a well-chosen spot for such a pillar.&nbsp; 2.
Its form and size&mdash;symbolising the earth quantity in its
weight of five millions of tons&mdash;the freight of 1,250 of the
largest steamers leaving New York.&nbsp; Its shape, or
inclination from base to apex, the same as from the pole to the
equator.&nbsp; To express this the builder sloped in ten feet for
every nine in height.&nbsp; On this building the sun can shine
upon the whole of it twice a year without a shadow.&nbsp; This
building is the most correctly orient of any structure on the
earth.&nbsp; It is the highest, largest, and oldest building on
earth, rising to the height of 486 feet and a fraction, which
height if multiplied by ten nine times gives the distance of the
earth from the sun; or pile a thousand million pyramids one on
the other, and the last would touch the sun.&nbsp; As it stood
perfect it was the circle squared; for the height is the radius
of a circle, whose circumference, if divided into four equal
parts, each part would equal one of the surface sides of the
base&mdash;closer in approximation than Walli&rsquo;s
Indivisibles, or Newton&rsquo;s Fluxions, or <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Liebnitz&rsquo;s Calculus.&nbsp; The door of entrance
was some forty-nine feet from its base, and 300 inches East of
the centre, so as at once to express the tilt of the
earth&rsquo;s axis from the plane of its orbit, and by its height
from the ground express the Precession of the Equinoxes.&nbsp;
What a witness outwardly, when complete, of polished marble,
covering some thirteen and a half acres, within and without clean
and free from idolatrous marks.&nbsp; But God foretold the place
and purpose of this huge pile through the prophet Isaiah (xix.
19, 20): &ldquo;In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord
in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border
thereof to the Lord.&nbsp; And it shall be for a sign and for a
witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here we see the <i>altar and pillar</i> are <i>one</i> and the
same, and a scientific fact is expressed when the prophet says it
shall be in the midst and on the border.&nbsp; The position of
the Pyramid is such, being at the sector point of Upper and Lower
Egypt, thus being on the border of both, yet in the midst.&nbsp;
The sector point of the arm is where the wrist joins the
hand.&nbsp; The spreading hand represents Lower, and the arm
Upper Egypt.&nbsp; (See on frontispiece the sector plate.)</p>
<p>May we ask what the pillar and witness&mdash;the
Pyramid&mdash;has to say on the Jewish question, for it has not
left this fact unnoticed?&nbsp; At the junction of the first
ascending passage with the Grand Gallery, on the left-hand side,
or East, there is a horizontal passage-way leading to what is
called the Queen&rsquo;s Chamber.&nbsp; This chamber is on the
twenty-fifth course of masonry.&nbsp; Now, it is allowed, the
Grand Gallery expresses the time of Christ&rsquo;s advent and
fulness of time&mdash;enlarged liberty.&nbsp; The ascending
passage being only four feet high, men were cramped in passing
up, but on reaching the Grand Gallery they were free, for it is
twenty-eight feet high.</p>
<p>The passage to the Queen&rsquo;s Chamber is only four feet,
and is it not strange that it is altogether Jewish?&nbsp; This
low horizontal passage terminates in a grand Sabbatic room, <!--
page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>which symbolises the Jewish Sabbath-week, feasts, and
time periods.</p>
<p>From this passage we learn that the Jews rejected Christ, and
went off by themselves, refusing the liberty of Christ.&nbsp; So
as truly as the coming of Christ had been forecast in this
Pyramid, so had His rejection by the Jews.</p>
<p>The very mortar in this chamber is mixed with salt.&nbsp; The
chamber is seven-sided.&nbsp; The last seventh of the passage-way
sinks down, giving more room to move in.&nbsp; Salt was an
article used freely with the Jews in sacrificing.&nbsp; Seven was
a sacred number.&nbsp; The sinking of the last seventh part of
the passageway floor may mean the enlarging privilege of the Jews
in this latter day.&nbsp; Of the civilised nations, only Russia
and Spain forbid them citizenship.&nbsp; Even Turkey admits them
now as citizens.</p>
<p>The Jews have been represented as being blind in part.&nbsp;
The passage-way and chamber have been difficult to explore
because of foul air, there being no ventilating tubes as in the
King&rsquo;s Chamber.</p>
<p>But, strange to say, a gentleman exploring this chamber a
short time ago, found two tubes by an accident in striking the
side wall with a hammer.&nbsp; The tubes had been left entirely
closed over with a thin unbroken scale.&nbsp; These tubes
extended inward through the masonry, and into the stones forming
the walls of the room, all nicely cut, but for about one inch
they were not cut through into the room itself.&nbsp; Thus the
whole was designed is evident.&nbsp; This thin scale no doubt
symbolises the condition of the Jew.&nbsp; His eyes are now open,
the time of his wandering nearly spent, as told by this
Pyramid.</p>
<p>The curses foretold upon the Jews have been terribly
fulfilled.&nbsp; So shall the blessings foretold now in
reserve.&nbsp; It was foretold that he would reject Christ; so he
did.&nbsp; But it is also foretold that he will yet look upon Him
whom he pierced, and mourn and repent, and accept the true
Messiah.&nbsp; Lo-ruhamah <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>represents
Lost Israel; Lo-Ammi represents cursed Judah; Ruhamah represents
Israel found; Ammi represents the curse removed from the
Jews.&nbsp; So now we must say, as the prophet Hosea long ago
instructed us&mdash;we Saxons&mdash;&ldquo;Say ye unto your
brother, Ammi,&rdquo; and you Jews, &ldquo;say to your sisters,
Ruhamah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have esteemed the Jews as cursed; we will soon esteem them
blest.&nbsp; The Jews have never thought we were their brethren,
the descendants of Abraham.&nbsp; But God is revealing in this
latter day His own great plan; and Christ will be the Saviour of
both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall
dwell safely.&nbsp; Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the
Lord, that they shall no more say, The Lord liveth, which brought
up the children of Israel out of Egypt; but, The Lord liveth,
which brought up, and which led the seed of the House of Israel
out of the North country, and from all countries whither I had
driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land&rdquo; (Jer.
xxiii. 6&ndash;8).</p>
<p>Glorious times are near at hand for the Church and the
world.&nbsp; Great things hath God promised, all of which He will
in His own good time bring to pass.</p>
<p>The very dimensions of the doorway are of thrilling import,
expressing in square inches the time of the Adamic world, which,
when added to other figures, forecast the time of the end, or the
6,000 years, and point out the date of the beginning of the
Millennium morn, or Sabbath of the earth&mdash;the period spoken
of by Daniel when he says, &ldquo;Blessed is he that waiteth, and
cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; This period we approximated in our last
Discourse, and made it out to be about 1,957.&nbsp; The door-way
in square inches is 1,949; take these inches for years, and we
have, before the building of the Pyramid, of years 1949 <span

1,882, and we get a total of 6,001.&nbsp; This is indeed a close
approximation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Egypt is intimately connected with Palestine in providential
history, both past, present, and future.&nbsp; No student can
have a proper knowledge of the Jewish and Israelitish nation
unless he be familiar with the early civilisation and power of
Egypt.&nbsp; From this land went forth the Caphtorim to settle
Palestine, led forth by the great and good Melchisedek, after he
had built the Pyramid.&nbsp; Under his reign they first settled
Palestine, built and made Jerusalem their capital.&nbsp; On the
death of Melchisedek they lost their allegiance to God, they
became an idolatrous people, and were rejected by Jehovah as His
special agents.&nbsp; They are known in after history under the
name of Philistines, which simply means the followers or subjects
of Philitis&mdash;a name which the early historians of Egypt gave
to the builder of <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>the Pyramid, which was none other
person than Melchisedek.&nbsp; By the Israelites they were driven
out of Palestine, and finally settled in the South of Ireland, as
Irish historians allow.</p>
<p>Another member of the family of Shem was called&mdash;namely,
Abraham, from whom came God&rsquo;s chosen people&mdash;Israel
and the Jews.&nbsp; They also had to sojourn in Egypt, and they,
too, were sent to Palestine, and graffed on to the purpose of
God, where the Philistines had been broken off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt,
and the Philistines from Caphtor?&rdquo; (Amos ix. 7).</p>
<p>Egypt has played a noble part in the providence of God through
Melchisedek, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses.&nbsp; Even the blessed
Jesus is said to be called from this land.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out of
Egypt have I called My Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Egyptians gave to
the world the first translation of the Hebrew Bible, and it was
for centuries the stronghold of Christianity after the
destruction of Jerusalem.&nbsp; The best of the Christian fathers
were Egyptians, and in the coming struggle, the great war, which
will begin about 1882, again Egypt will become conspicuous with
England and Prussia.&nbsp; For the Prussians are the Assyrians as
the English art the Lost Tribes of Israel.&nbsp; Bismarck may
man&oelig;uvre as he please, and be as pro-Russian as Dr. Storrs,
yet when the time comes he and his people will fall in with the
providential purpose, and become an ally with Israel-England; and
timid and bankrupt Egypt will then come forth to take her place
once more among the nations of the earth as an independent
Power.&nbsp; Hear what the prophet Isaiah says in chap. xix.:
&ldquo;And the Lord shall smite Egypt, He shall smite and heal
it, and they shall return even to the Lord, and He shall be
entreated of them, and shall heal them.&nbsp; In that day shall
there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians
shall come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria, and the
Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.&nbsp; In that day shall
Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>in the midst of the land, whom the Lord of hosts shall
bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Assyria the work
of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>In that day</i>&rdquo; refers to this day, now at
hand.&nbsp; To this the Great Pyramid is witness.&nbsp; For in
verses 19 and 20 of this chapter we read: &ldquo;In <i>that
day</i> shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the
land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the
Lord.&nbsp; And <span class="smcap">it</span> shall be for a
<span class="smcap">sign</span> and for a <span
class="smcap">witness</span> unto the Lord of hosts in the land
of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word translated pillar is from the Hebrew word Matzaybhah,
and means a large structure&mdash;some monument that is
pre-eminent.&nbsp; The Hebrew word Ammood is translated pillar
also, and corresponds to the English word pillar much better.</p>
<p>The word <i>altar</i>, in Hebrew, means lion, carrying with it
the same meaning as pre-eminence.&nbsp; And is not this Pyramid
preeminent? and is it not the lion of monuments, pre-eminent as
being the oldest, pre-eminent as being the highest, pre-eminent
as being the largest, pre-eminent in location&mdash;being
<i>central</i> to all the land surface of the earth, pre-eminent
in construction, unlike any other buildings, except such as have
been modelled after it, pre-eminent in orientation&mdash;that is,
being exactly East, North, West and South.</p>
<p>Perfect orientation men in past ages and countries have tried
to express in temples, churches, observatories, and monuments,
yet none have succeeded so well as the Pyramid builders.</p>
<p>The famous Uranibourg Observatory, built by aid of the
European Governments, under the skilful supervision of the
learned Tycho Brahe, was found to be five minutes of a degree
askew in its orientation when finished.</p>
<p>A few years ago our Government determined to have one perfect
point of orientation, fixing upon Mount Agamenticus in the State
of Maine.&nbsp; They, at a great cost, and time, and labour,
concluded their work, and found they were in error <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>somewhere about the four-hundredth part of a second;
although they tried to solve the problem by three distinct
processes&mdash;namely, differences of zenith distance, absolute
zenith distances, and by transits in prime vertical.</p>
<p>How then came these ancient architects so early in the
world&rsquo;s history and progress to build so skilfully?&nbsp;
How were they able some 4,000 years ago to find the poles, and
determine the latitude and longitude so precisely?&nbsp; Answer,
ye godless scientists, and tell us how these monkey-men were so
skilled.&nbsp; How did they know without your instruments and
instruction which parallel of latitude to choose so as to be on
that line which would mark the half-way of the world&rsquo;s
surface between the equator and the poles?</p>
<p>And why did they lay bare and make smooth the lime-stone table
rock on which they built close to its Northern edge?&nbsp; Why
press so closely to the brink of the hill on the North side when
there was plenty of room on the South side?</p>
<p>Truly this witness of God is against you.&nbsp; In this
building are &ldquo;signs and wonders&rdquo; even to this day,
and as surely also are the eyes of Jehovah open upon all the ways
of the children of men.</p>
<p>Know ye not that the accumulated forces and results of
centuries have been bequeathed to the present generation as a
legal heritage for culture and profit?</p>
<p>Happily for us God has not left Himself without
witnesses.&nbsp; Long before God made bare His arm through Moses,
and wrought miracles to convince Pharaoh and the Egyptians, He
had wrought one miracle, a miracle which would cover the ages;
not to be seen by a few only, or last for a day, but to be seen
by the millions and last for centuries.</p>
<p>In this Pyramid we have a valuable inheritance.&nbsp; Its
finish, its beauty, its magnitude provokes our criticism, and yet
must command our admiration.&nbsp; This watchman on the walls of
time, this sentinel in charge of the secrets and treasures of
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>the sires of long ago, this prophet in the wilderness
in rugged garb, proclaiming the will of Heaven, as then made
known, and now manifest, this Daniel who can interpret for us the
future, this mile-stone of the ages, we do revere.</p>
<p>By it we are enabled to adjust our chronological dates,
rectify history in some of its most important points, and judge
more correctly of the attainments of our ancestors; nay, more and
better, to form a truer estimate of ourselves and discern the
finger of God in the manipulations of men, and an overruling
Providence in the rise and fall of nations.</p>
<p>These signs and wonders confirm God&rsquo;s Word, for they
prove inspiration a fact; inspiration of a kind and in the very
manner demanded by the unbelieving scientists.&nbsp; Here is a
building superhuman, and of course in part supernatural, like the
Bible.&nbsp; In this building the human and the Divine blend.</p>
<p>If any deny this, it remains with them to account for it, and
show how a people so far back in the world&rsquo;s history could
be so wise and learned; how they could embody so much of the
sciences.&nbsp; One thing is certain, if the Divine had nothing
to do with this building, then we are left to the conclusion that
man was much superior to what the Darwinian theory admits.&nbsp;
If void of the Divine, then the development theory is
destroyed.&nbsp; If we admit the Divine, then it follows that
inspiration is a fact.</p>
<p>The building is there, and it was there in the day of
Egypt&rsquo;s oldest historians.&nbsp; It has been counted as one
of the seven wonders of the world.</p>
<p>It did not embody the ideas of the Egyptians in science,
astronomy, meteorology, or religion.&nbsp; As their historians
allow, it was built by foreigners which they hated.</p>
<p>Nothing idolatrous was carved on it, within or without.&nbsp;
It was a witness pure and clean.&nbsp; The Egyptians proclaimed
and believed the earth to be square&mdash;this building
proclaimed the earth round.&nbsp; The builders bevelled the face
of the rock in a <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>ratio of eight inches to the
mile&mdash;the very quantity that science to-day admits to be the
curviture of the earth&mdash;and accepts in surveying.&nbsp; It
was their knowledge of this fact that kept the building sound,
without the cracking of a joint, through centuries, though so
high.&nbsp; The Egyptians did not use the sacred amma, or cubit,
which is about twenty-five of our inches.&nbsp; They used a
profane cubit, as Sir Isaac Newton shows.</p>
<p>This sacred cubit was a well and easily established proportion
of the earth&rsquo;s diameter&mdash;the very standard now used by
the English Government in surveying.</p>
<p>The stones of the Pyramid were twelve feet long, eight feet
broad, and five deep, making twenty-five total.&nbsp; The
building itself was a five-faced figure.&nbsp; The Egyptians
hated five.&nbsp; No wonder that Moses harnessed the Israelites
in fives as they left Egypt, or that he should divide his book
into five parts.</p>
<p>No wonder that the Queen&rsquo;s Chamber should be on the
twenty-fifth course of masonry, and the King&rsquo;s Chamber on
the fiftieth course, which is the year of jubilee, or
deliverance&mdash;which year, as indicated in the Pyramid, is the
year 1935.</p>
<p>The Egyptians calculated from the moon in their
chronology.&nbsp; But this building takes its calculations from
the sun circle.&nbsp; The Egyptian year was 354 days, with an
intercalary month of thirty-three days added every three
years.</p>
<p>The year embodied in the Pyramid was 365 days, five hours,
forty-eight minutes, forty-seven and seven-tenths seconds.&nbsp;
If a person took a rod of a cubit length, and measured one of the
base sides of the Pyramid, he would find this twenty-five inch
measure to be contained as often as there are days in the year,
with the same fraction in inches as the hours, minutes, and
seconds.</p>
<p>Is it impious to ask how these builders knew the solar year so
completely?&nbsp; They knew the sun&rsquo;s circle of 448 years,
which completes a circle of time without any excess or
deficiency.&nbsp; This they ran into weights and measures as
God&rsquo;s religion does.</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>The Pyramid, having four sides, would divide this
circle into four parts, which make 112 pounds, or a
hundred-weight; or, if multiplied by five, the faces of the
Pyramid, 448 would give 2,240, or a ton.</p>
<p>In the descending and ascending passages a person must stoop
to pass through them, but when the Grand Gallery is reached, they
can stand upright, for this gallery enlarges seven times the
proportions of the others.&nbsp; The first passages are only four
feet high; this is twenty-eight.</p>
<p>The first ascending passage is 1,542 inches in
length&mdash;the time, taking inches for years, from the exodus
of Israel from Egypt to Christ.</p>
<p>Christ brings enlarged liberty.&nbsp; He was symbolised by the
ton&mdash;the end of weight scale.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the fulness
of time was come, God sent forth His Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, thirty-three inches in this gallery is an open
sepulchre with fifty-six empty graves in miniature, carved out,
telling, again, by a strange coincident, the life years of the
Saviour and His resurrection; also the number of those who rose
immediately after.&nbsp; For &ldquo;the graves were opened, and
many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the
graves after His resurrection&rdquo; (Matt. xxvii. 52).</p>
<p>Another remarkable feature is, that at the end of this
gallery, the wall bulges forward about four inches, as if it were
going to fall in.&nbsp; This gallery, on the floor is 1,882
inches; on the roof, 1,878 inches.&nbsp; This explains to us our
very times.&nbsp; The shadow of war&mdash;Russia and England
appearing as if they would fight every day.&nbsp; But they know
not the counsels of God, nor His sublime purpose.&nbsp; Surely,
as the text declares, &ldquo;Our God is great in counsel and
mighty in work; and His eyes are open upon all the ways of the
sons of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; More next Sunday evening, God willing,
about His own marvellous witnesses.&nbsp; Let us praise and adore
Him.</p>

<p>The closing of the famous European Congress will now freely
permit us to canvass the work and results of the same, and to
compare the sequences with the teachings of the prophets and
intentions of Providence.&nbsp; The results of the Congress have
taken the world by surprise.&nbsp; The very fact that one should
have been held under the enforced conditions of the crownless
king, Disraeli, was a wonder in itself.&nbsp; But the wonder is
not <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>confined to the meeting and work of
the Congress, for outside of, and in spite of the Congress, a
treaty has been made which converts wonder into amazement.&nbsp;
Back in the middle of last May (1878), England and Turkey formed
an alliance, offensive and defensive.&nbsp; Nay, more, for Turkey
cedes to England the fruitful and strategic island of
Cyprus.&nbsp; What a triangle of strongholds&mdash;Cyprus, Malta,
and Gibraltar!&nbsp; Shades of Bonaparte!&nbsp; Where is France
in these days?&nbsp; She is renewing her strength, and is wisely
standing aside so as not to oppose Providence.&nbsp; In all this
there is nothing new or strange to the prophetic student.&nbsp;
For long ago it was written of Israel that she should be a
company of nations, and possess the gates of her enemies.</p>
<p>It is not by might, nor power of human origin, that these
events must be judged, or that they come to pass.&nbsp; But
surely by the Spirit of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a spirit in
man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth it
understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Job gives us the key to unlock
the mysteries of the crownless king and his success.&nbsp; The
apothegm of Bonaparte is as false as he was
unsuccessful&mdash;namely, that Providence is always on the side
of the strongest battalions.&nbsp; In Israel, in time of old,
this was seldom true.&nbsp; In fact, it was not true in the
experience and campaigns of Bonaparte.&nbsp; The logic of such a
faith has been the ruin of lovely France more than once, and will
be again.&nbsp; For it must needs be that France break her
alliance with England, though now they are friends.&nbsp; France
in a few years will ally with the Beast, the Roman Church, in its
last struggle for rule and supremacy; and she will join hands
with Anti-Christ.&nbsp; France will repeat the follies of
&rsquo;93.&nbsp; She will again seek to dethrone Religion, and
enthrone Reason.&nbsp; Her Marats, Desmoulens, Herberts,
Clootzes, and Robespierres are at hand ready to overturn.&nbsp;
And the Church of her choice is patiently waiting to re-enact the
scenes of blood and terror of St. Bartholomew.&nbsp; Her time of
opportunity will appear to have come in a few years.&nbsp;

and Germany will languish for want of two equal successors.&nbsp;
And France will not forget to pay back the debt of revenge she
owes to Germany, and seek to reclaim her prestige in councils,
and especially to restore her lost influence over Egypt, Turkey,
and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Last year it would not have been so easy to see how France and
England were to become once again enemies.&nbsp; This Cyprus
wedge has cleft open a little farther the dark and mysterious
way.</p>
<p>Last Monday we received the astounding telegram of the treaty
between England and Turkey.&nbsp; It evidently was a surprise, we
have no doubt, even to Rev. Dr. Storrs, and the <i>New York
Herald</i>, as well as to many others who could see nothing but
defeat and shame for Israel-England.&nbsp; From Dr. Storrs we
have not heard what he now thinks of his child of promise,
Russia.&nbsp; From the <i>Herald</i> we did hear, for, by the
way, the <i>Herald</i> is one of our morning papers.&nbsp; By an
editorial of a column and a half the <i>Herald</i> struggled
nobly to wriggle out of the tight corner in which its sympathies
for Russia had crowded it.&nbsp; We like and admire the
<i>Herald</i>, because of its tact and ingenuity in getting news
first from any part of the world.&nbsp; Still this time she was
behind time.&nbsp; Two years ago, from this pulpit, we announced
the exciting facts of the past week.&nbsp; Last Sunday evening we
closed our discourse in these words: &ldquo;Now, again, England
pledges herself a Continental Power, nay, more, an Asiatic
Power.&nbsp; She will come forth from the Congress the virtual
ruler of Turkey, the owner of Palestine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Saxons be the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel&mdash;and most
certainly they respond to all the features that were to
distinctly mark them when found, as written in the
Bible&mdash;then the English throne is a continuation of
David&rsquo;s throne, and the seed on it must be the seed of
David, and the inference is clear&mdash;namely, that all the
blessings attaching by holy promise to <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>David&rsquo;s throne must belong to England.&nbsp; This
is the key that unravels and makes plain the marvellous and
sublime history of the English nation and throne.&nbsp; We know
many scout the idea of the Lost Tribes ever being found, although
over thirty times God declares by the prophets that they must
return; surely before they return they must be found.&nbsp; God
has not cast away His people for ever.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; He
declares Israel to be His inheritance, and that this people He
had formed for Himself.</p>
<p>The Two Tribes forming the Jews of to-day are said by the best
calculation to number about nine millions.&nbsp; If, then, the
Two Tribes number nine millions, how many ought we to expect the
Ten Tribes to number?&nbsp; If the Two Tribes have stood and
survived the shock and persecution of centuries when known, and
therefore open to assault, is it not reasonable to suppose that
the Ten Tribes will be in existence, a numerous and powerful
people, for they have been hid, and thus have they evaded the
persecution that a knowledge of their nationality would have
entailed upon them from the Gentile and Pagan nations?</p>
<p>Some, indeed, persist in looking for God&rsquo;s chosen
seed&mdash;His people, His inheritance&mdash;among the bushmen of
Africa, the Indians of America; indeed wherever they can find a
people mean, and few, and very low in the scale of
civilisation.&nbsp; They overlook the fact that Israel, not the
Jews, were to be the most powerful and prolific people on the
face of the earth, to be as sands of the sea, as the stars of
heaven.&nbsp; Especially were these promises to be true in the
latter day&mdash;for then God promises to multiply them, men,
beasts, and the fruits of the field.&nbsp; This is one of the
signs of the times, and it is a remarkable one.&nbsp; See our
harvest, see our cattle, and see the Saxon race&mdash;doubling,
at least, every forty years.&nbsp; No other nation is doubling at
that rate.&nbsp; Germany comes the nearest, and both in Prussia
and Austria they only double every one hundred years.&nbsp; In
one hundred years from to-day the Saxons will control the world
for peace and Christ.</p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>To this end God is overturning, and will overturn until
the whole world shall be federated around one throne, and that
throne is David&rsquo;s&mdash;the only throne God ever directly
established, and the only one He has promised perpetuity
to.&nbsp; God has a land&mdash;Palestine.&nbsp; He has a
people&mdash;Israel.&nbsp; He has a throne&mdash;David&rsquo;s,
and for that throne He has a seed, just as the seed of Levi was
selected for Temple service.</p>
<p>This kingdom is the fifth kingdom, to be set up in the latter
days of those kings, says Daniel.&nbsp; The kingdom was never to
be left unto other people.&nbsp; It is typified by the stone cut
out of the mountain that is to fill the world.&nbsp; Why then
stand amazed at the cession of Cyprus to England, if she be
Israel.&nbsp; To her was promised the isles of the sea, the
coasts of the earth, the waste and desolate places&mdash;the
heathen and uttermost parts of the earth, as a possession.&nbsp;
Already out of the fifty-one million square miles which composes
the earth, England, including the United States, now owns about
fourteen millions, or say one-fourth.&nbsp; She bears rule over
one-third of the people of the earth; she adds a colony every
four years on an average.&nbsp; At the present rate it will not
be long before the kingdoms of this world will be given to the
saints of the Most High.&nbsp; It is no marvel in the light and
instruction of prophecy that this throne and people should be so
stable and prosperous.</p>
<p>Turn your attention to the founding of this throne of
David.&nbsp; You will find the throne and seed unconditionally
federated, the place and measure of prosperity conditioned on the
obedience of the people and throne to God.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord
has sworn in truth unto David; He will not turn from it; of
<i>the fruit of thy body</i> will I set upon thy throne&rdquo;
(Psalm cxxxii. 11).&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;I have sworn unto David,
thy seed I will <i>establish for ever</i>, and build up thy
throne to <i>all</i> generations&rdquo; (Psalm lxxxix. 3,
4).&nbsp; This promise is to all generations&mdash;not a part,
nor simply for sixty years.&nbsp; For the kingdom was rent in
twain when Rehoboam, the grandson of David, began to reign.&nbsp;
The throne <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>of David would be about the poorest
type of Christ&rsquo;s throne and rule, and reign, if we can only
see it in Palestine.&nbsp; There it was soon divided, very
corrupt.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye can break My covenant of the day and
night in their season, then may also My covenant be broken with
David My servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his
throne . . . Thus saith the Lord: If My covenant be not with day
and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven
and earth, then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David My
servant, so that I will not take any of <i>his seed</i> to be
rulers over the seed of Abraham&rdquo; (Jer. xxxiii. 25,
26).&nbsp; Let anybody of the same mind read the seventh chapter
of the second book of Samuel, and they will see that God promised
to David that his house and kingdom should be established for
ever, and that God would set up the seed of David after
him.&nbsp; Well might David exclaim when he sat before the Lord,
&ldquo;Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that Thou hast
brought me hitherto?&nbsp; And this was yet a small thing in Thy
sight, O Lord God; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy
<i>servant&rsquo;s house for a great while yet to
come</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a pity men will not take and
interpret the Bible by the rules of common sense.</p>
<p>David at this time was king over all the Tribes and was at
peace, and settled and prospered.&nbsp; But God told him that
&ldquo;He would appoint a place for <i>My people Israel</i>, and
will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and
move no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; This promise was to Israel.&nbsp; If
the promises of the multitudinous seed were to be fulfilled to
Israel, then it would be necessary to find them another place,
for Palestine wouldn&rsquo;t hold them.&nbsp; So God has planted
them.&nbsp; God never promised to find the Jews another country;
Palestine is specially reserved for them.&nbsp; They have been
without country, king, or government.&nbsp; In the year 725 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Jews and Israelites were separated,
and since that time they have never been united.&nbsp; But the
day is coming, says the prophet, when they shall dwell <!-- page
181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>together and appoint one head over them.&nbsp; The
Israelites are only to return to Palestine representatively (Jer.
iii. 14).</p>
<p>When Nebuchadnezzar carried the Jews captive, he took the
king, Zedekiah, with him, and destroyed all his family, and all
the real royal seed of David.&nbsp; Zedekiah died in
Babylon.&nbsp; He placed upon the throne of David,
Gedaliah.&nbsp; Now Gedaliah was not of the seed royal: but God
was displeased and permitted the crown to go to others.&nbsp;
Ezekiel was taken captive to Babylon in the reign of Jehoiachim,
the father of Zedekiah.&nbsp; The prophecy of the text was
written in Babylon, and refers to Zedekiah, whom Ezekiel calls
the &ldquo;wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, iniquity
shall have an end.&nbsp; Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the
diadem and take off the crown, this shall not be the same; exalt
him that is low, and abase him that is high.&nbsp; I will
overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it shall be no more until He
comes whose right it is; and I will give it to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all this is plain if we keep in mind that Zedekiah was the
last prince of the House of David that ever reigned in
Palestine.&nbsp; God removed the diadem.&nbsp; But in the course
of time a lawful heir of the seed of David shall appear, and the
throne and the seed will be established again in Jerusalem.&nbsp;
It is to this end Providence is overturning Turkey to make way
for this seed royal.&nbsp; But where is this seed royal?&nbsp;
Answer: It is on the English throne.&nbsp; Listen carefully to
the following:</p>
<p>Jeremiah tells us that with him he had the daughters of
Zedekiah, who had by some means escaped the destroying edicts of
Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. xliii. 6).&nbsp; And from Jer. xliv. 14, we
learn that they visited Egypt, and from Jer. xliv. 28, we learn
that a small number escaped.&nbsp; Now Jeremiah, being the only
prophet in Judah at that time, had a right to take charge of the
royal seed.&nbsp; He could not stay in Egypt, nor in Palestine,
nor would he go to Babylon.&nbsp; Where, then, did the prophet
go?&nbsp; He no doubt took ship with the Danites, and sailed for
Cornwall, in <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>England, for this place was called
Tarshish.&nbsp; We learn from Ezekiel the ships of Dan traded in
tin, and other things.&nbsp; History and tradition both agree
that there landed on the coast of Ireland in the North, a divine
man and a princess.&nbsp; God had promised to Jeremiah his life
wherever he went.&nbsp; &ldquo;But thy life will I give thee for
a prey in all places whither thou goest&rdquo; (Jer. xlv. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p182.jpg">
<img alt="Jacob&rsquo;s Stone" src="images/p182.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The North of Ireland had been settled with the Tribe of Dan;
they at once understood who their visitor was.&nbsp; They called
him Olam Folla, meaning a Divine man or teacher.&nbsp; The
princess was called Tea Tephi, the beautiful one from the
East.&nbsp; This princess was married to Heremon, of Ulster, the
king of Lothair Croffin, for such was the name of the city of
Tara.&nbsp; This word Tara is Arat spelled backward.&nbsp; The
Hebrew reads from right to left; English left to right.&nbsp;
Lothair Croffin was changed into Tara at the time of the
wedding.&nbsp; Tara means law.&nbsp; Thus began the seed of David
to take root, and from there it spread over all Ireland, then to
Scotland, thence to England, and Jacob&rsquo;s Stone in
Westminster Abbey marks the journey of David&rsquo;s throne, and
has always kept with the seed, and they have been always crowned
on it.&nbsp; Ezekiel&rsquo;s riddle is at once solved.&nbsp; The
tender twigs were Zedekiah&rsquo;s daughters.&nbsp; One <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of
these twigs was planted by the great waters in a land of
traffic.&nbsp; Our Episcopalian friends intended by their
beautiful service to aid the members of their communion to read
in order, and through the Bible, or a given portion of each
chapter, once per year.&nbsp; But strange to say, this 17th
chapter of Ezekiel, they have left out both of the Old and New
Lectionary.&nbsp; It is itself a riddle, why this should so
happen, that the only two chapters of the Bible left out or
proscribed are the 17th and 21st of Ezekiel.&nbsp; Surely
blindness in part has happened to Israel, and what we esteemed as
accidental in the increased light of Revelation, stands to view
as the ordered purposes of an all-seeing God.</p>
<p>The royal standard of England has nine lions on it and a
unicorn.&nbsp; Let anyone set this standard before him as a map,
the right hand will represent East, the top North, left West, the
bottom South.&nbsp; The unicorn comes from the East, it has a
chain round its neck.&nbsp; So the Tribe of Benjamin came that
way, and, as Normans, were finally attached to the throne.&nbsp;
The big lion comes from the West, so it did from Ireland to
Scotland and London.&nbsp; On the top we have a crown, and on the
top of this we have a lion.&nbsp; On the first quarter are three
lions, second quarter one, on the third a stringed harp with an
angel&rsquo;s head, and on the fourth three lions, the total of
lions nine, and an unicorn.&nbsp; The fact is, this standard, had
we time, teaches a world of history, and with the Psalmist we may
say: &ldquo;Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee; that
it may be displayed because of the truth&rdquo; (Psalm lx.
4).&nbsp; The genealogy and descent of Queen Victoria from
Zedekiah we will furnish you.&nbsp; This genealogy has been got

Glover, M.A., and Rev. A. B. Grimaldi, M.A., two Episcopalian
clergymen of England.&nbsp; The chart is supposed to be as near
perfect as any such thing can be.&nbsp; If any of you find any

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See, I have this day set thee over the
nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and
to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to
plant.&rdquo;&mdash;Jer. i. 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these words we have set forth the Divine commission given
to the prophet Jeremiah.&nbsp; Never before, or since, was such a
commission given to mortal man.&nbsp; It is not that Jeremiah is
constituted a prophet for his own people, or over his own nation,
and country, but he was Divinely appointed and set over the
nations and kingdoms of the earth, with an authority &ldquo;to
root out, pull down, destroy, and throw down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely
he was rightly named, for the word Jeremiah means the exalted, or
appointed one of the Lord.&nbsp; By common consent, the Jews gave
him the first place and name among the prophets.&nbsp; Up to the
time of the Babylonian captivity he was second, Isaiah being
first.&nbsp; But after the captivity, on the re-arrangement of
the holy canon, his name was put first, and ever after he was
regarded and accepted as the patron saint of Judea.&nbsp; He was
born of a priestly family, about 641 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, in the priestly town of Anathoth,
which was situated a few miles North of Jerusalem, in the
territory of Benjamin.&nbsp; His work and commission awaited him,
because they antedated his birth, <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>for he says
(chap. i. 4), &ldquo;Then the word of the Lord came unto me,
saying, Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before
thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I
ordained thee a <i>prophet unto the nations</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jeremiah&rsquo;s life-work, extent, and devotion, can only find a
parallel in the majesty and compass of his commission.&nbsp; It
is the extent of this commission that I wish you would specially
notice, for it is neither tribal nor national in its
limitations.&nbsp; He was ordained a prophet unto the
nations.&nbsp; Hear the voice of his wailing (chapter xv. 10),
&ldquo;Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of
strife and a man of contention to the <i>whole
earth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consistent with the vastness of this commission is the
recorded fact that he was forbidden to marry in his own land, for
&ldquo;the Word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Thou shalt not
take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons and daughters in
this place&rdquo; (Jeremiah xvi. 2).&nbsp; The claims of a wife
and cares of a family could only have been harshly fitted on to
such a work and commission.&nbsp; Indeed, every peculiar fact in
the life of Jeremiah may be best accounted for by taking into
consideration the greatness of his commission.&nbsp; To discard
this is simply to invite confusion, and yet, strange to say, many
prefer confusion rather than admit that he performed the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> assigned him of Heaven.&nbsp; For this very
reason writers, even Jewish historians, are at a loss to account
for the latter half of the prophet&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; They do
not seem to know where he spent his last days; they know not the
time, manner, nor place of his death.&nbsp; And why, you
ask?&nbsp; We answer, Because they selfishly and persistently
limited his life and labours to his own land.&nbsp; They have not
been willing to allow that he was set as a prophet over nations
and kingdoms.&nbsp; Then again, they have been willing to allow
him to be a puller down and destroyer, but not a builder and
planter.&nbsp; To grant that he was a builder and planter, would
have obliged them to have found the place of his building and the
objects of his planting.&nbsp; These they well knew <!-- page
192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>could not be found in Palestine, and they were as loath
as many are unwilling to-day to permit Jeremiah to leave his own
land.&nbsp; A man who would be equal to the Bible must be
large-hearted, generous, and free, not fettered and bound by the
errors of youthful training, the selfishness of sectarianism, the
bigotry of orthodoxy, or the indifference of infidelity, but seek
the truth, no matter from whence, or what it upsets or overturns
of preconceived ideas.&nbsp; The command is, &ldquo;Prove all
things, and hold fast that which is good.&rdquo;&nbsp; To hear
some people talk and lament, you would think that the command
was, Prove nothing, but hold hard on to what you have got.</p>
<p>Try now, and reasonably and patiently follow me while I trace
the wanderings of Jeremiah to Old Ireland.&nbsp; You will be
surprised to find how intimate Irishology and theology are.</p>
<p>Ireland and the Tribe of Dan have a peculiar history, which
history only can be made plain by reference to the Bible.&nbsp;
Ireland has had much to undergo, yet of it God says, &ldquo;To
the islands He will repay recompense: so shall they fear the name
of the Lord from the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ireland&rsquo;s first name was Scuite&rsquo;s Land, or the
Island of the Wanderers.&nbsp; Her second name was Scotia Major,
and Scotland was Scotia Minor, and England was Tarshish, and
Dannoii and Baratamac, or Land of Tin.&nbsp; Yar in Eirin means
the land of the setting sun.&nbsp; Hibernia is an Hebrew word,
and means from beyond the river of waters.</p>
<p>Two colonies settled in Ireland; the first, the
Ph&oelig;nicians, who were the Philistines or ancient Canaanites;
the second settlers were the Tuath de Danan, meaning the Tribe of
Dan.&nbsp; The words are Hebrew, yet in Irish.&nbsp; For further
information let any one read &ldquo;Pinnock&rsquo;s Catechism on
Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Ph&oelig;nicians were a sea-faring
people; pressed by Israel, Egypt, and Assyria, they finally left
Canaan, and settled in Ireland.&nbsp; We find nine-tenths of
Irish historians agreeing on this.&nbsp; Then the monuments teach
the same&mdash;ancient inscriptions, one of <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>which
written was, &ldquo;We are Canaanites who have fled from Joshua,
the son of Nun, the robber.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people who show
tourists the seven churches of Glendenlough, say they are
Hittites and Hivites.&nbsp; Again, ruins of Baal temples,
Cromlechs, round towers, go to confirm the same.&nbsp;
Customs&mdash;Baal fires, on May eve, in Irish Ninna-baal-tinne;
funeral wakes, or cup of consolation, forbidden to Israel when
they sought to copy after the Philistines.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither
shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for father or
mother&rdquo; (Jer. xvi. 7).&nbsp; The Irish language came from
the Ph&oelig;nician, the alphabet of both being composed of
sixteen letters originally, the only alphabet in the world so
agreeing.&nbsp; From the Irish came the Gaelic, Welsh, Cornwall,
and the Manx from them all.</p>
<p>The second settlement of Ireland is what puzzles historians of
to-day&mdash;not the old historians, for they, nine out of ten,
admit that the Formorians, Firbolgs, and Tuath de Danans, were
one and the same people.&nbsp; They were a divine folk.&nbsp; The
Tribe of Dan was a sea-faring Tribe, trading from Tyre to
Tarshish for tin, and so became acquainted with the British
Isles, and during Ahab&rsquo;s persecution many of them fled; so
of the Simeonites who settled in Wales.&nbsp; This shows us why
the North and South of Ireland should be so distinct to this day
in religion, enterprise, and general characteristics.&nbsp; When
the Tribe of Dan finally left Palestine, they with the other Nine
Tribes went North, settling in Denmark, as in the North of
Ireland, leaving their names on rivers, hills, cities, and
things.</p>
<p>It is this that accounts for so many words of an Hebrew origin
being found in the Irish language.&nbsp; General Vallancy has
compared thousands and finds them thus related to the
Hebrew.&nbsp; Instance: Jobhan-Moran, Chief Justice; Rectaire,
Judge; Mur-Ollam, School of the Prophets; Ollam-Folla, Divine
Teacher; Mergech, a Depository; Tara, Law; Tephi, Prince of the
East; Lia-Fail, Stone of Destiny; Eden Gedoulah, Precious
Stone.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>If to Irish history we join Bible history, all is
plain.&nbsp; God promised David repeatedly that he should always
have his throne and on it his seed.&nbsp; The permanence of
David&rsquo;s throne makes it a fit type of Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Now, Jeremiah took charge of Zedekiah&rsquo;s daughter when
Nebuchadnezzar took the Jews captive.&nbsp; He went to Egypt,
then escaped, God promising to keep him whithersoever he
went.&nbsp; So he disappears.&nbsp; No account of his death in
the Bible.&nbsp; He had charge of the ark of the covenant, royal
seed and Jacob&rsquo;s pillow&mdash;the stone of Israel.&nbsp;
Irish histories, some twenty of which we find agree, say that
about 585 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, a divine man landed in
Ulster, having with him the king&rsquo;s daughter, stone of
destiny, and ark, and many other wonderful things.&nbsp; The
people of Ulster, of Dan, understood the old adventurer.&nbsp;
Jeremiah married Tephi, Zedekiah&rsquo;s daughter, to Eoiacaid,
who agreed to abandon Baal worship and build a school for the
prophets.&nbsp; So he did.&nbsp; He then assumed the title of
Heremon of Tara.&nbsp; From Tara, which was changed from Lothair
Croffin into Tara.&nbsp; From Tephi comes our goddess of Liberty,
on old coins, sitting on a lion.&nbsp; Now, at Tara, Jeremiah
buried the ark of the covenant, tables of law, &amp;c., and
instituted the nine-arch degree of Masonry, to keep in mind its
hiding-place,&mdash;so all may understand Jer. iii. 16:
&ldquo;And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and
increased in the land, in those days, saith the Lord, they shall
say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord; neither shall
it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall
they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This means that when the ark is found the ceremony will end; for
the ark has to be found and go before the Jews when they return
to their own land.&nbsp; Jeremiah was the first Grand
Master.&nbsp; He, too, is the real St. Patrick&mdash;simply the
Patriarchal Saint, which became St. Patriarch, then St.
Patrick.&nbsp; The Roman Church introduced St. Patrick to offset
the St. Patriarch.</p>
<p>Jeremiah well knew where the Tribes of Israel were in his <!--
page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>day.&nbsp; He knew that Judah, Levi, and Benjamin, were
in Babylon, filling in the seventy years of captivity, and the
small remnant that Nebuchadnezzar left of them in Judah were
scattered hither and thither.&nbsp; The Nine Tribes, or Israel,
were settled in Central Asia, and were spreading Northward and
Westward.&nbsp; This he knew, as easily as Peter did centuries
after, when he wrote his epistle to the brethren, scattered
abroad in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Asia; or as James, who
dedicated his epistle to the Twelve Tribes which were scattered
abroad; or as the Blessed Master who commissioned and sent His
disciples after the lost sheep of the House of Israel.&nbsp; The
place and locality of the Nine Tribes were known to the Jewish
nation in the time of Josephus, the historian, for he speaks of
them, and gives them a fraternal letter which the House of Judah
sent unto the House of Israel.&nbsp; You are to keep in mind that
it is after this the Tribes of Israel are to be lost.&nbsp; All
prophecies after 700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, up to this,
our day, and till about 1882 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
that had reference to Israel, plainly mark out the dwelling-place
of these Tribes, and yet these prophecies not being understood,
till these latter days, Israel was as actually lost as if there
had been no such prophecies.&nbsp; These prophecies were first
sent North, then West, and then to the &ldquo;isles of the
sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The law of the Gospel of Jesus would be sent to
these Tribes; till then the &ldquo;isles had to wait for the
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; In due time this law was carried to them by the
missionary Tribe of Benjamin.&nbsp; This very thing and time the
prophet had foretold, for he says: &ldquo;Wherefore glorify ye
the Lord by the Urim; the name of the Lord God of Israel in the
islands of the Western sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; How true, indeed
&ldquo;the isles of the sea saw it and feared.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Jeremiah knew that the Tribe of Dan were a seafaring people, and
in their trading they had become acquainted with Northern Europe
and the British Isles.&nbsp; During the persecutions of Ahab
thousands of them had left Palestine, settling in
Denmark&mdash;this word Denmark means the circle of Dan.&nbsp; In
course of time they <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>crossed the sea and took possession
of the North of Ireland, settling in the province of
Ulster.&nbsp; The Tribe of Simeon, that had ever cast its lot
with Dan, left Palestine and settled in Wales.&nbsp; Read the
prophetic benedictions of the patriarch Jacob in the light of
these historical facts, and they will stand out in sunlight
brightness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dan shall judge his people as <i>one</i>
of the Tribes of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his <i>oneness</i>, all
alone he shall go out first, mark out and prepare the way of the
other Tribes; and the royal seed, the ruling power, shall hide
itself in him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dan shall be a serpent by the way; an
adder in the path that biteth the horses&rsquo; heels so that his
rider shall fall backward.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, Dan will be hid
among the Gentiles.&nbsp; He will bite them, sting them,
frustrating their purposes.&nbsp; Then exclaims Jacob: &ldquo;I
have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dan did wait,
until the prophet Jeremiah landed in his midst with Tea Tephi,
the daughter of Zedekiah, the royal seed, with the ark of the
covenant, the tables of the law, the Urim and Thummim, which
would enable Dan to judge his people, with the stone of Jacob,
the pillar witness, which is now in the royal chair in
Westminster Abbey; and also with the standard of Judah.&nbsp;
Thus the prophet, who was the rightful custodian of all these
things, carefully cared for the same, leaving them in charge of
Dan.&nbsp; All but the stone have been concealed till the latter
day.&nbsp; For on this stone have been crowned all the kings and
queens of David&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>Now just here we must take up history&mdash;especially Irish
history&mdash;for in this matter and at this very point, you will
find profane and sacred histories agreeing.&nbsp; One will
beautifully explain the other; nor can anybody understand Irish
history unless they get the key from sacred history.&nbsp; To
take this key later writers have been unwilling, and, therefore,
they have been unable to solve the problem embodied in this race
and nation.&nbsp; No people on the face of the earth have been
less understood and more misrepresented.&nbsp; The real
allophyllians of <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Ireland&mdash;that is, the first
native settlers&mdash;are unknown.&nbsp; The present inhabitants
are not autochthonal, no more than we are the first settlers of
this country.&nbsp; On one point all old historians are
agreed&mdash;namely, that Ireland has been settled by two
distinct colonies of people; and from these two colonies came the
present Irish race.&nbsp; These two colonies were distinct in
features, manners, customs, enterprise, and religion, and after
all these centuries have passed away, these differences are
discernable in some degree, especially so in enterprise and
religion.&nbsp; And though, of course, in these latter years,
they have become considerably mixed, yet an appeal on either of
these points will mark out the Danite from the
Ph&oelig;nician.&nbsp; From the loud boasting of the
Ph&oelig;nician Irishman in Ireland, when speaking of America,
you would think that he would pluck out his eyes and give them
for a gift if need be.&nbsp; Well, a few years ago, Chicago was
bitterly scourged with a fire.&nbsp; The need and distress thus
caused appealed to the nations of the earth for help.&nbsp; The
response was grand and glorious.&nbsp; Even hateful old John Bull
did well.&nbsp; But what did Ireland do?&nbsp; Take two of her
leading cities as an example; one in the North, the other in the
South.&nbsp; Belfast in the North, of the Tribe of Dan; Dublin in
the South, of the Ph&oelig;nicians.&nbsp; Belfast sent 36,000
dols.; Dublin, 2,000 dols.&nbsp; Why this difference?&nbsp; We
answer, Forsooth, the people of Belfast are Danites; they of
Dublin are Ph&oelig;nicians.</p>
<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians, or Philistines, were the ancient
Canaanites.&nbsp; They took early possession of Ireland.&nbsp; On
this point the old as well as the new historians generally
agree.&nbsp; But there was another early settlement in the North
of Ireland whom the historians called <i>Tuath de Danan</i>,
which simply means the folks of the Tribe of Dan.&nbsp; They
introduced into the Irish language hundreds of Hebrew words, with
many customs and legends of the Hebrews.&nbsp; They were very
distinct in their enterprise and religion from the other
settlers.&nbsp; About the year 580 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> there <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>appeared
before this people a strange man, whom the historians call
<i>Ollam-Folla</i>, which means a divine teacher; the name or
title is in Hebrew.&nbsp; This man, whoever he was, soon wielded
great power in their midst.&nbsp; What he commanded they seemed
ready to do.&nbsp; He very soon inaugurated wonderful
reforms.&nbsp; He gave them a parliament, made them give up their
idolatrous customs.&nbsp; He founded a college to train students
to teach and preach his religion.&nbsp; It was called
<i>Mur-Ollam</i>, school of the Divine.&nbsp; Here again the name
is Hebrew, although in Irish.&nbsp; This wonderful man had with
him a fair young princess, whose name in Hebrew-Irish was <i>Tea
Tephi</i>, which means the beautiful one from the East.&nbsp;
This lovely princess was married to the governor of Ulster,
Heremon.&nbsp; He resided in the City of Lothair Croffin.&nbsp;
In the agreement of the marriage, among many things, he was to
accept her religion, give her joint authority, and build the
Mur-Ollam, or college, and sustain it.&nbsp; Also to change the
name of his city from <i>Lothair Croffin</i> to <i>Tara</i>,
which means law; to adopt her standard or banner emblem, the harp
and lion, and to be crowned on the wonderful stone called in
Irish-Hebrew, <i>Lia-Fail</i>, which means stone of destiny,
sometimes called <i>Eben Gedoulah</i>, the precious stone.&nbsp;
From this Tea Tephi we get our female goddess of liberty, who on
old coins is seated upon a lion with the Davidian harp in her
hand.</p>
<p>Our text tells us that Jeremiah was to plant and build
up.&nbsp; Here he planted, and here he did build.&nbsp; He
planted and built a throne, a college, and a religion.&nbsp; Turn
to Ezekiel, chapter xvi., and read the famous riddle.&nbsp; Tea
Tephi is the tender twig that was cropped off from the high
cedar, King Zedekiah, and planted among the merchants by great
waters on the mountain of Israel.&nbsp; She was the tender one
that was to take root downward.&nbsp; To Jeremiah, the Lord said,
&ldquo;Verily it shall be well with thy remnant.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nay, more, He told him that He would give him his life for a prey
whithersoever he went.&nbsp; And in 2 Kings xix. 30, we read:
&ldquo;And the remnant that is escaped of the <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>House of
Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit
upward.&nbsp; For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and
they that escape out of Mount Zion; the zeal of the Lord of hosts
shall do this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Ezekiel, in his captivity, sent
forth a prophecy referring to the wicked prince, Zedekiah, saying
of his throne in the name of Jehovah: &ldquo;I will overturn,
overturn, overturn it, and it shall be no more until He comes
whose right it is, and I will give it Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So was
this throne overturned, and was never after established in
Jerusalem.&nbsp; You will notice that there are three
overturnings, and as Scriptural language is emphatic and not
superfluous or tautological, these overturnings mean
something.&nbsp; Turn to history, and you will find this throne
has been turned over just three times&mdash;first, from Jerusalem
to Ireland; second, through King Fergus to Scotland, and, third,
through King James, from Scotland to England.&nbsp; This throne
can never be turned over again, for Jerusalem will be
incorporated into the British Empire.&nbsp; The throne has turned
over till it got home again; hence, as surely as we live,
Palestine will go into the hands of England.&nbsp; The throne,
religion, and education established by the prophet have ever kept
together.&nbsp; This is the secret of Ireland&rsquo;s prestige
and marvellous pre-eminence in centuries past.&nbsp; The college
of Armach could boast of 7,000 students at a time.&nbsp;
Missionaries went forth from Ireland through all Europe, teaching
Christianity, and founding schools.&nbsp; Few men can compare to
Virgilus, Eregina, Columbanus, and Columba.&nbsp; In olden times
she was known as the &ldquo;Isle of the Saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
day of Ireland&rsquo;s weakness and distress came to her when she
permitted her religion to be corrupted and controlled by
foreigners; and by these same Italian intriguers she is now
impoverished and enslaved.&nbsp; But for this the throne might
have remained with her to-day, and England and Scotland have been
under her.&nbsp; But when a nation loses her religion, she loses

200</span>Jeremiah was the patron-saint for Ireland for a long
time.&nbsp; Simeon (the Welsh) had and have David; and as surely
as the Welsh have kept their saint, so surely ought
Ireland.&nbsp; St. Patrick is looked upon by many as a mythical
person.&nbsp; I believe, however, that he was a veritable
man.&nbsp; The best authorities make out that he was born at
Bonavena, in ancient Gaul, near what is now called Boulogne, some
time about 387 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>&nbsp; He is
reported as having died March 17th, 465, in the county
Down.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s name was Calpurnius.&nbsp; Young
Calpurnius, or St. Patrick, as he was afterwards called, had a
hard life of it in youth.&nbsp; I believe him to have been a
Benjamite, a Christian; for the Benjamites began to fill in that
part of France about that period.&nbsp; This Tribe were by nature
missionaries.&nbsp; This prompted him to desire to redeem his
brethren in Ireland.&nbsp; In Ulster he began his labours.&nbsp;
From this same Tribe others had visited Ireland.&nbsp; History
mentions four who preceded St. Patrick.&nbsp; The name of St.
Paul, by many, is connected with a visit to Ireland.&nbsp; It is
very easy to see how Jeremiah, the patron-saint of Judah, would
be installed in such a relation with the Danites after his
death.&nbsp; He was the real sainted patriarch of Ireland.&nbsp;
And by a crafty design of Rome, young Calpurnius was created
sainted patriarch, or St. Patrick, and by this means Rome linked
the greater part of the Irish nation on to herself.&nbsp; Anybody
honest and familiar with history knows that St. Patrick was a
Christian, and in no sense of the word a Roman Catholic.&nbsp;
The fact is, Rome began early to covet Ireland.&nbsp; Once they
got possession, it was necessary for them to destroy the
influence of Jeremiah.&nbsp; This they did, in part, by
substituting the name of St. Patrick in the place of the
prophet&rsquo;s; and more, they then set to work to destroy even
the old and famous capital city of Tara.&nbsp; In 565 St.
Ruadham, along with a <i>posse</i> of bishops and chiefs of the
South of Ireland, cursed the city, so that neither King nor Queen
might ever rule or reign therein again.&nbsp; They forced the
government, monarchy <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>and people to abandon the
place.&nbsp; From thence Tara was deserted, and the harp sounded
no more through Tara&rsquo;s halls.&nbsp; The city thus cursed
crumbled to ruins, and remains to this day buried, awaiting a
glorious resurrection.&nbsp; Rome caught her prize at last; but
neither Rome nor any other power ever enslaved or conquered
Ulster.&nbsp; Beyond the pale&mdash;that is, the dividing line,
running from the Boyne to the Shannon&mdash;Rome never got, nor
never will.&nbsp; Irishmen clamour for independence, to be free
from England, and wonder why they are not.&nbsp; The reason is
that God cannot trust liberty to them; for a people that yoke
themselves to a foreigner, and give themselves over to be
governed in spiritual matters, would make a poor effort if
trusted with their temporal government.&nbsp; We all know that if
Ireland had been free, she would not long have remained so, for
body, as well as soul, she would have committed to the
Italians.&nbsp; Why Irish Catholics should ask for freedom when
they so voluntarily bind themselves to a foreigner, I fail to
see.&nbsp; As the Protestants of the North have asked, and had
granted, spiritual freedom in the severance of Church and State,
so let the men of the South ask and demand, and stop not short of
freedom from Rome.&nbsp; A free religion is the parent of a free
State, and a free State of free school.&nbsp; A people who are
not wise enough to take care of their own religion, are very
poorly prepared to be the guardians of liberty.&nbsp; My belief
is that Ireland ought to be free.&nbsp; She ought to be an
independent province, with responsible government, as other
English provinces.&nbsp; And once she becomes free religiously,
it will not be long before she will be free politically.&nbsp;
Substitute Jeremiah for St. Patrick, and the Lord Jesus for the
Pope, then the day of freedom will not long tarry.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
